            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Truth of Infants being real Members of the visible Church, and Subjects of the great Ordinance of Baptism, have been maintained both by pen and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them that have been famous in the Congregation, and men of Renown, both for parts and piety; and this at all times, and in divers manners and ways; and what is here presented to your view, is but a mite cast into that treasure; wherein they that have been rich with grace and gifts, have cast in much, and the Widows two mites was not despised, but observed and commended by the Lord Jesus, <hi>Luke 21.2, 3.</hi> As to them that cannot contain, but must manifest their dislike of it, I shall endeavour to speak a few things in answering their Objections that are made, or may be supposed to be made, and leave the whole Issue to the blessing of God Almighty, whose Will revealed in his Word, I have desired to search for the whole of it.</p>
            <p>First, Some may be ready to object against what is here written, and say, What need there be any more writing upon this subject when there is enough said &amp; written already?</p>
            <p>Answer, May it not be so said of every truth of the Gospel, in that there have been so much said and written of it, and this by Eminent persons in all generations, and yet is there not need of more to be said and written of it still?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Do what others have done and said in this case, Excuse any that are contemporary with them, or that come up after them, from the discharge of their duty, whose work it is to make k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own the whole counsel of God.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Have There been enough said of this nature, That <hi>John</hi> the Baptists did as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly Baptize Infants as the Adult? If so, they must shew by what auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rs and at what time; or else be found false Witneses of them that they Intimate have done enough, and be found false accusers of this small tract.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> If Others that are gone before have said so much, then this sheweth, that they had a high esteem of the priveledges of children or Infants, in that they left so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them of their labours to vindicate it, and maintain it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> If Others have done so much that are gone before, What a shame is it that they that are now at their work, should be able to say nothing more but what they have said before?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> If Others have said so much, then this sheweth that they were great labourers and had Eagle eyes, and large Grasps, that they should grasp every thing of the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for this truth in the word of God, and leave no gleanings for any, or all that come after them, tho as much bound to study, and to declare the whole counsel of God as them.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> This must argue, that the Fountain of the Word of God is shallow, and narrow, that some few poor Mortals could catch all the fish of Truth in their Nets, and fathome the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pth of that Fountain.</p>
            <p>Or else, that all succeeding Labourers are either pur-blind, and cannot see the truth, or lazy, and do not search after truth. All which I esteem as dreadful Assertions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God's Word's Fullness, and his faithful Servants Endowments, and laborious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: Where <hi>the Preacher is w se, there is still seeking out, and setting in order acceptable words,</hi> Eccl <hi>12.9, 10. Every Scribe instructed in the Kingdom
<pb facs="tcp:42051:3"/> of God, bringeth forth of his treasure things old and new.</hi> Was this limited to the time only of the famous Labourers departed? <hi>Mat. 13.52.</hi> If not New for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet for manner it may be New.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <hi>9.</hi> Then all that must be said to stop the mouths of gainsayers in this case, must be had from the Labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of others from the Word, but not any thing of our own seeking out, or setting in order. <hi>10.</hi> Gainsayers do not say it is enough.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <hi>11.</hi> The Vulgar of poor Ignorant people do not say it is enough; but they ask for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to answer the Assertions of gain-sayers of this Truth, and those that seek to draw them as Discip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es after them.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <hi>12</hi> If there is enough said and printed already, why have many no more Answers ready to stop the mouths of gain-sayers in this case?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Some may object and say, it is against the Judgment of the Learned; and therefore some will scorn it.</p>
            <p>I Answer, These Learned Persons that it is against, are supposed to have that Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from their being endued either with Humane or Divine Learning. If it is with respect to their being endued with Humane Learning that this is objected, I ask whether this can be said to be against it? when it is another Matter, and of another Nature than what that Learning consisteth in, or treateth of?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> I ask, whether humane Learning is to be the sole Judge and Determiner of any thing of Supernatural and Divine Revelation?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Whether nothing is Truth but what is warranted by that?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Tho I do not desire to undervalue one Tittle of the Excellency of humane Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet I am perswaded, that all parts of God's Worship, and the Warrant, for who shall partake of Baptism, have a better Foundation and a Warrant of a higher Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than all the Philosophers in general, or any in particular cauld seal.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If it's with respect to their Divine Learning, which is the benefit and blessing of the Word of God and their keeping to that as their Rule, that this is said to be against; then let any shew what Texts of Scripture it is that they have declared their Judgments upon, and proved their Judgment by other Scriptures, or given in their Reasons from the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alogy of Faith; and yet their Judgment is gone contrary to, being so proved and confirmed, and let the Author bear the blame of it; or else, if the Judgment of the Learned and truly Godly, being proved and confirmed by Scripture, cannot be produced as contradicted, let them that make this Objection, bear the blame of being false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses for the Learned, and false Accusers of the Author.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> I ask, whether all that is done by any, in the pleading the Cause of Truth, is to be rejected, because in something it is different from the Judgment of some Learned Men, tho it may otherwise be a certain Truth, and clearly proved by Scripture?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> If it be a fault worthy such great condemnation, in one thing to differ from the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>And to add to this, against the Learned: Revilings and Reproachings, as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian, and as being the worst of sinners, that sin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

               </gap>wledge;
<pb facs="tcp:42051:3"/> in administring Gods Ordinances to them that they know Ordinances do not belong to; and, in a manner, of humane invention. And for so base ends as to obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the vulgar. And a thousand times more than this.</p>
            <p>If I am a Transgressor in differing in some one thing from them that my soul's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is to love and reverence. Then surely many that make this Objection sin more. And they that are in this case guilty, must condemn themselves first, in a greater measure more than the Author.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> Will any learned men undertake to prove, that the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is warrant enough, to Baptize the Children, and Infants of the Gentiles, that embrace the Gospel: But it was not sufficient ground nor warrant for the Infants of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be baptised. But they must all be cast out of the Church of God; at that time when they were real members thereof, and so Owned, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and Threatned and Commanded as Church members, by the Baptisors. But only a few Publicans and Harlots, and a Generation of Vipers, must be baptised; that could gain a right for themselves by confession of their sins. And the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> signifie nothing; neither to Adult nor Infant.</p>
            <p>If any will do it for the future, yet none have written and published this as their judgments already. And therefore without this caa be produced, the accusation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the judgment of the Learned in this case, must pass for too rash a censure. If the Lord by his Immediate Officers had turned out all Infants among the <hi>Jews,</hi> from being admitted to partake of baptism, then. It would be a hard task for any of the most learned to bring them in among the Gentiles to partake of it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> These learned men that are brought by way of opposition, must be either dead or alive. If they are yet alive, and in this world, whose judgments are opposed. And these persons that make this Objection have any veneration for them, and their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. How dare they, that have little or no learning, undertake to be a mouth for them? Do they commend them for learning, and yet suppose them not capable of speaking for themselves? or for the Truth they have publickly asserted? If they do, they do by this shew more contempt to them, than the Author has shewed, or does even desire to shew to them. Are not they as sufficient to shew any their error as ever?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> If these learned men are dead, and in another world, they are at Heaven, or at Hell. If at Heaven, beholding and enjoying the blesledness of, knowing and keeping to Truth. And if they were to come forth of Heaven into this World again, can any imagine, that they would condemn, and spurn at the meanest of their fellow ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for maintaining by Scripture, a truth of so great concernment to souls, and greatly making for the Peace, Ʋnity and Amity of the Church of God, and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of Free Grace and the Honour of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If thousands were of such a mind, out of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice against truth, I do not question but another day, they will be of another mind. But how ever until these learned persons have declared their dislike of any thing that does not agree with their judgments, I do not know why others should declare against any truth for their sakes, and be more zealous for their Honour, and their Authority, than they are themselves, and do appear to shew their dislike.</p>

            <p>THE Way and Means whereby we may have sure and certain Grounds for the satisfaction of our Souls in this case; and firm and sure Foundation for our Faith herein, is from the Word of God; which is <hi>the more sure Word of Prophesie,</hi> to which we are to look in all cases, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. and in this especially; it being an Ordinance of great Moment and Concernment, even the Door of Admission to, and the Foundation upon which all other Visible Church-Priviledges are built. And also it is that by which all are to have the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost put upon them; and that also by which all that do, have the Priviledge of bearing the Name of Christians in this World, as to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Means.</p>
            <p>And without which all must, and do stand, as total Strangers to all Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church-Priviledges, and Visible Bodies of Christianity, as not being of the Number that are of the Visible Church of Christ, or External Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>John</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.3, 4 And in case any are Rejectors of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, the Lord Jesus Christ himself testifieth, that such, and all such, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest the Counsel of God against themselves, Luke</hi> 7.30. It is the Counsel of God without Restriction, or Limitation, which sheweth it is all the Counsel of God. And it being the Ordinance of Initiation, it must be of all the rest; And a certain declaring, that they will have none of Christ, like them, <hi>Psalm</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. And if they did so greatly sin, that rejected <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, they can never be more Innocent, and less Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors that did reject, or do reject Christ's Baptism.</p>
            <p>And every Soul under the Gospel, or the preaching thereof, must, and will most certa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nly be found at last, an Accepter, or Rejecter of the whole, and of every part of Christ and Christianity, <hi>John</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.30. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.13, 14, 27.</p>
            <p>And if all must be Accepters, or Rejecters; then all, and every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual person, are under, and must have as great, express, particular, and authoritative Command, to accep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r and Manner as another.</p>
            <p>For none can be a Rejecter, or Refuser of that which he never had the Offer and Tender of, not never can he be under the like Guilt every way, in the refusing and rejecting, as another, if the Offer was not every way
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42051:6"/> the same, and if he were not under the same command to accept as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor is it possible for any person to be guilty of so dreadful a sin, as the rejection of Christ, and his Ordinances; that is not under a command to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them; for where there is no <hi>Law, there is not, nor can be any transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rom</hi> 4.15. And if there is warrant for every Soul to receive the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus in his Ordinances, surely the Word of God is full and sufficient enough to evidence it to us, if we search into it, and that with as much clearness, and as express, and as particular Warrant for one as for another, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant as for the Adult, and for the Female as for the Male; or else the threatning could never be as express against me as against another, nor the same punishment be contained in it against me, as against another; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by God's Assistance I shall endeavour to search diligently into the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those General Expressions recorded in the Word of God, by which those that were the Subjects of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, are set forth; and of the Texts of Scripture in which we have the Subjects of <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, or the person's he baptized, set forth, are, in Matth. 3.5, 6. <hi>Then went out to him Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and all Judea, and all the Region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</hi> Mark 1:5. <hi>And there went out to him all the Land of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the River of Jordan, confessing their sins.</hi> Luke 3.7. <hi>Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O Generation of Vipers? who hath warned you to flee from the Wrath to come.</hi> Ver. 21. <hi>Now when all the people were baptized,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now in any, or all of these Texts, and the Expressions used in them, there is no mention made, whether they were Male or Female, Adult or Infant, Men, Women or Children; but general Expressions, as they of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> all <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>all the Region round about Jordan, the multitude, and all the people were baptized of him in J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdan.</hi> But if there be Men, Women and Children contained in, and intended by these Expressions, <hi>Jerusalem, all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, all the Region, the multitude, all the people;</hi> then we be to understand it of all these; that is, of Men, Women and Children, Adult and Infant; and we are to believe the Testimony of the Holy Ghost, and his Witness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one of these Ages and Sexes as well as another, as intended by, and contained in those gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al Expressions. And it is as much a sin not to believe the Report the Holy Ghost maketh in Scripture concerning one of these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or Sexes, contained in these general Expressions, and intend d by them, as of another; for the Report binds every Soul to believe what is witnessed in Scripture concerning every one contained in, and intended by these gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expressions, as much as concerning any one.</p>
            <p>Here be none in particular expressed neither Infant nor Adult, Male nor Female; And if any shall deny the <hi>Infant</hi> to be thereby meant and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, another may deny the <hi>Adult</hi> to be thereby meant and intended, and with as much ground and warrant from the Text as any do deny the <hi>Infant;</hi> for there is no ground or warrant to deny either, or for any to question it, upon serious consideration of the Words. And if any shall deny the Female to be thereby meant, another may deny the Male to be thereby meant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42051:6"/> And so there must be none thereby intended, neither Male nor Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, Infant nor Adult. All the people were the Subjects or Objects of <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry and Administrations, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24. <hi>When John had first preached to all the people of Israel the Baptism of Repentance.</hi> Here are none mentioned in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, either of Age, Sex, Condition, Qualification, Office or Opinion whatsoever; but <hi>to all the people of Israel,</hi> and <hi>throughout all Judea.</hi> And if the Holy Ghost have restrained it to none in particular, how dare any poor Mortals do it! And if any do dare to do it, is that a sufficient ground for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to believe it? Or if some do say it, and others believe what they say, do or will that prove it to be a Truth? If the saying of things by some, and the believing of them by others, would make any thing, or many things true, then all the Doctrines of Devils must be true; for there be some that say, and publish them, and others that believe them. But whatever some men do say, or others believe of their sayings, I desire to search diligently what the Holy Ghost does say of these general Expressions in other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that so we may understand the meaning of them, and have Scripture ground for our Faith herein.</p>
            <p>But before we come to an enquiry into the Expressions particularly, it may be of advantage for the vulgar satisfaction, to take notice, That we have in general, from <hi>John</hi>'s own words, that he did speak to the People, in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to them, a discovery of whom we are to understand these Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and who are intended by them, and contained in them, that is by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> or they of <hi>Jerusalem, Mark</hi> 1.5. <hi>And all</hi> Judea, <hi>and all the region round about</hi> Jordan. <hi>All the People, and the Multitude, Matt.</hi> 3.5, 6, 9, 10, 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.7, 8, 9, 17, 21. <hi>Mark</hi> 3.5, 6. Where we have the Expressions explained, as shall be shewed afterwards; but for the present, it is enough that the Holy Ghost doth witness, That his Exhortation, or his Tender of Baptism was to all <hi>Israel,</hi> or to all the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> Acts 13.24. Which comprehended every Soul of the Seed of <hi>Israel</hi> then in being in this World, and in that Land at that time, when <hi>John</hi> Preached the Baptism of Repentance amongst them. And if every Soul in <hi>Israel</hi> that did not hear that Prophet, was to be destroyed from the People, then it was spoken to all and spoken by way of command, or else how could any one Soul be guilty of so dreadful a sin as to bring utter destruction upon himself, and as to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed from among the People for not hearing and obeying that Prophet, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.42, 43, 44. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35, 36, 37, 38.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us now enquire into the meaning of the general expressions that sets forth them that <hi>John</hi> Baptized.</p>
            <p>And the first to be enquired into is <hi>Jerusalem. Then went out to him</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, Mark 1.5. <hi>And there went out unto him all the Land of</hi> Judea, <hi>and they of</hi> Jerusalem: It is not said all <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or that all they of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> went out to him and were Baptized; for there were the Pharisees and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, that were notorious rejectors of <hi>John's</hi> Baptism; and all such as they could Disciple to them, which doubtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ss might be many; and those they kept back, and shut up the Kingdom of God against. And these our Lord

And this the Holy Ghost maketh plain and clear by the expression in <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5. Where it is expresly said, them of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that is them that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> And so it must be understood of necessity; For I suppose none do deny, or can deny, but it must be meant of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it self, that is the place so called, or else the Inhabitants of the place: As to the place, none dare be so gross in their Assertions, as to say it was the place it self so called, that came to <hi>John;</hi> but if any should, yet the Text, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5. clearly and expresly overturns that Imagination, in that it is said. <hi>They of</hi> Jerusalem, which must be understood of the Inhabitants of the Place, and not the Place it self. And in that, <hi>Matthew</hi> expresseth them by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> it sheweth that they were the greater Part, or the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Inhabitants of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

            <p>They that came forth of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> must be said to be of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> by birth, as being born there, or by having that Place given to them from the Lord, when the Land was divided among the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>Lot, Joshua</hi> 15.63.

            <p>If any were said to be of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by birth, must not Infants be said to be so to, by the same parity of Reason? Was not Christ said to be of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> from his being born there, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.5, 6. Secondly, If any were said to be of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> because that place was given from the Lord by <hi>Lot,</hi> to their Ancestors; when the Lord was divided to the Tribes of <hi>Israel, Joshua</hi> 15.63. Was not the smallest Infant that was born there a Subject of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the Land, as well as those Adult Persons to whom then it was given at the Division of the Land at first? If the Infants of those Parents should have been Excluded from having as real a Right to be there as their Parents, whither must the Children be sent; and where must they have a place of abode when their Parents were Dead? And who must come to Dwell at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when these Adult Parents were all Dead? And if the Infants had it not given to them as well as the Parents, how could any of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Generations come to be Inhabitants there, or to be of that place? See <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 11.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. If it was by being Sojourners there, that they were said to be of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> If the Parents were of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in this sense were not the infants too? are not Infants with Parents, and in the City where they be?</p>
            <p>Observe, That in whatsoever sense any will make some to be of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they must make all them that were of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and that came to <hi>John</hi> to be Baptized of him to be, for they are all expressed by they of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and some must not be of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in divers ways and manners different from others to make them all Adult, when the holy Ghost do express them all as of one and the same capacity, they of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> with respect to their being of that City: but if any do not like the interpretation given, they may at their pleasure give another, and prove it by Scripture, and be thanked for it. Only let all consider that they of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> do contain only <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, and such as were really joyned to the Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> not the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were stangers, nor any <hi>Samaritaines, Matth.</hi> 10, 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>But a little further, to enquire who this Phrase do contain in it, whether the adult only, or wherher adult and infants also?</p>
            <p>Jer. 14.2.3. <hi>The cry of Jerusalem is gone up, their Nobles have sent their little ones to the Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word for little ones is from <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> signifying small in quantity, and in quality: And it is not said, they were sent by themselves, or upon their own Personal Natural Feet; they may be sent, tho in others arms.</p>
            <p>Can any Soul living say, that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> do not in that Text contain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as well as adult? Do not the smallest Infants cry when they have not the means of sustentation, <hi>Lament.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The Children and the Sucklings swoon in the Streets of the City.</hi> 12. verse, <hi>They say to their Mothers, where is Corn and Wine?

And verse 15th. And in verse 19. <hi>Arise, cry out in the Night. — Lift vp thy hands towards him for the life of thy young Children that faint for hunger in the top of every street,</hi> verse 20. <hi>a span long.</hi> Which Texts do shew clearly that Children and Infants did cry in the time of Famine in <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And the Text, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.2. does expresly prove old and young, adult and infant to be intended by the Phrase <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or the cry of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> See also <hi>Lament.</hi> 4.4, 10, verses.</p>
            <p>We may see that this Phrase do comprehends young and old in <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.17. <hi>Seest thou what they do in the Cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, and the Fathers kindle the fire, and the Women kneed their Dough, to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some will say that this Text does not speak of Infants, Infants cannot gather Wood.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Hebrew word for Children is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> used again in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. for to express Children when brought forth.</p>
            <p>And this sheweth that the word <hi>Jerusalem</hi> comprehends both old and young. And can any imagine that the smallest Infants were cast out, and excluded from being of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at that time? If the Infants were not of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> how did the Children come there that were so young? And it is enough for the case under debate, that by the Phrase <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is meant old and young, adult and infant; and tho the smallest infant could not gather wood; yet in holy Duties, and publick Ordinances, where they were among the <hi>Jews</hi> under the same express command to be there, as the Adult, then when expressed by an expressions that comprehend old and young, male and female. We are not to bind the meaning of the Holy Ghost to the adult on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but to take it in the largest sense, as comprehending all sexes and ages, because all were under a command to be there, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1, 2. compared with 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.15. compared with <hi>Joshua</hi> 8.32, 33.34.35. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.1, 2, 3.</p>

            <p>So also another Text to prove the old and young are intended by this Phrase <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> See <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.3.4, 5. Jerusalem <hi>shall be called a City of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and every man with his staff in his hand for very age, and the streets of the City shall be full of boys and gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>If any object and say, This doth not argue or prove that they come forth, tho they were there, for they are not expressed. Answer, No more are the Adult Expressed; and if it will not prove that the Infants came forth, no more must it prove tha the Adult came forth.</p>
            <p>For they are all contained in the Phrase <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> verse the 3d, And in God's return to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and his being j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And if the Promise of Mercy do oblige any to duty, it must oblige all or none; it proveth all to be Subjects of the Promise of Mercy as the Seed of <hi>Israel,</hi> among whom God would dwell, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.3. and they are contained in the terms <hi>Zion,</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and therefore obliged to duty; and sinners if they did not, and every Soul that did not hearken to Christ should be destroyed, <hi>Acts</hi> 3, 23.</p>
            <p>So also in <hi>Psalm</hi> 147.12, 13. <hi>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem, praise thy God, O Zion; for he hath strengthned the Bars ef thy Gates, he hath blessed thy children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee.</hi> Hence the term <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is declared, to comprehend Children; therefore it cannot be limited to the Adult only. If any object and say, that this Text means Adult as well as Children,</p>
            <p>I Answer, If the Adult are called Children, doth that exclude Children, and the youngest of Children, even Infants, to be thereby intended? If Parents are but Children of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> are not Infants too?</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42051:8"/>
            <p>If any will not have Children to be meant, and intended by the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in Scripture, then they must prove that Children were not, nor are not of them that are blessed. And then there must never be any Adult blessed. For if exempted of being of the number of them, that are blessed when in infancy, they must be for ever exempted, witness <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Esau.</hi> They that are cursed Children when young, are so when old, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. And so there must be none in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> blessed. The seed that the Lord doth bless, are not rejected with a final curse, though the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing be not yet manifested and actually conferred upon them. <hi>Solomon</hi> was blessed when he was but a little Child, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. And <hi>Paul</hi> separated from his Mothers Womb, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15 Known unto God are all his Works, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.17, 18. Though not manifested or known to us till his pleasure, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. Though by nature all are Children of wrath in the first <hi>Adam, Ephes.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Yet the Text speaks <hi>Psalm</hi> 147.13. of the bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing that was conferred by God. The Infants were blessed by Christ, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14, 15. And the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being subjects of the promise, and capable of receiving a Blessing, must needs be reckoned of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and among the Blessed.</p>
            <p>So that it is evident that the expression, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> doth contain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Infants, as well as the Adult.</p>
            <p>So also, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4. If Children were not intended in the term <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> how should Babes rule over them, and Children be their Princes?</p>
            <p>But to see what the Scripture doth witness a little further of this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. If Infants and Children are not intended by this expression <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> then they must be none of them whose hearts are to be washed from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; and what will become of all Infants then? I leave all the world to judge, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Infants and Children are not intended and meant by this term <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> then they must be none of them, the foreskins of whose hearts are and must be Circumcised, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. Contrary to the very express Gospel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They must be none of them against whom the fury of the Lord may come out like fire; and that is as true as all other Imagina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. They must not be of them that are to be instructed, nor of them from whom Gods Soul may depart, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9, 10. Nor of them that may share, or have part in being subjects of desolation, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.8.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If they are not of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> then they are not to be wept for, nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented over; contrary to Christs express words, Luke 23.28. <hi>Weep for your selves, and your Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. If Infants are not intended by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> then the believing <hi>Jews</hi> had no Children, or else they had care for the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were in all other parts, but none for their own Infants or Children, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.19, to 26.

            <p n="8">8. Then they must not be of the Number that should partake of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, when one <hi>stone should not be left upon another,</hi> Luke 19.44.</p>

If Infants and Children are not contained in the expression <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> then they mast be none of them, <hi>which be made free by Christ,</hi> nor none of them <hi>that are in bondage,</hi> Gal. 4.25, 26. They must be neither <hi>under the Covenant of Works,</hi> nor <hi>the Covenant of Grace;</hi> and I wonder then, where all Infants must be in another World! And how it is that Death; or any of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers of Death have any Dominion over them? And if they be under no Covenant, whence are they <hi>Children of wrath by nature,</hi> Ephes. 2.3. Surely <hi>Jerusalem</hi> do intend Infants as well as the Adult there, or of that place; <hi>that came to John to be baptised.</hi>

            <p n="11">11. Then they must be none to whom the Promise do belong that is in <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10, 11. Nor be any of the House of <hi>David,</hi> nor of any Family in <hi>Israel.</hi> But must be disowned and cast out in the Wilderness, as well as shut out from <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>

            <p>So that we have good foundation for our Faith, to believe that <hi>John Baptist</hi> did as certainly baptise Infants in the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as he did baptise the Adult. By the explication that the holy Spirit of God gives in the word, of the acceptation of the first general expression, whereby they that were baptised are set forth, <hi>viz.

               </gap>nt of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the Men, Women and Children signifieth one and the same. And thereby is meant every Family of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and every s ul or person of every F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mily in the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all and every Infant that lived to grow up to the age of men, of them that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and also lived to have Children, when grown up, had not been baptised; how could all the Fathers have been said to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptised? 1 Cor. 10 2.</p>
            <p>So that we are to understand by all <hi>Judah,</hi> Men, Women and Children, Adult and Infant in the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> And one is as expresly mentioned as another; the Infant as the Adult, and the Male as the Female.</p>
            <p>If any object and say, <hi>That by the Word All, or All</hi> Judah, <hi>we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, only some of all Sexes, Ages and Conditions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And not every individual person</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answer,</hi> If by All <hi>Judah</hi> be meant only some of all Sorts, Sexes and Conditions whatsoever. Then some Infants must be there, as well as some Adult; or else some of all Ages could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be there. And then all others must be discharged from guilt, or the least sin that they were not there, and free from all liableness or obnoxiousness to the threatning men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. Denounced by God against every soul, that did not hear that Prophet; or else prove that was a hearing of Christ personally Preaching: And discharge them from sin in not hearing any Prophet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them in the name of the Lord; and make <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle then to charge them wrongfully; and restrain the Preaching of <hi>John</hi> to some of all Sorts, Sexes and Conditions in <hi>Israel, Acts</hi> 13.24. And shew who these of all Ages were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If any object and say, <hi>All the Elect in</hi> Judah <hi>are here intended by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42051:10"/> Judah;</hi> yet then there must be some Infants, or else prove, that no Infant is elected; and then there must be no Adult elect; for Election was before all time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If any say, by <hi>all Judah</hi> we are to understand all the Godly of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> that were truly converted. Then they must prove, that no Infant is called and converted, or el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e grant some Infants to be there; and then also make the Church to be invisible, and deny a visible Church; and also prove that any Minister can know who are truly godly; and then the Elect must be excluded the Visible Church, and Visible Means, if not called, as well as them that are not Elect; and how then shall they ever be called or converted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If any say, that by <hi>all Judea</hi> we are to understand them only that could make a publick confession of their sins; for here is mention made of their confession of their sins. I answer, Then they must exclude from the Visible Church, and External Means of Salvation, all Elect and Called, and all Adult as well as Infants that could not make a publick confession of their sins. And when they that make this Objection must tell what sins they were that they confessed, whether of Nature or Practice, Heart or Life, Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Commission, sins of Infirmity, or notorious and heinous; then they must shut out too, all those that could not confess these sins, because they had not committed them, except they will make this a Confession wherein they did do they knew not what? And when all this is done, they must make this Act of Confession to be of greater concernment than Election, or Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Conversion or Calling, or any thing else; for all things else are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without this; and this only gives Right, when nothing else will, or can, to partake of Baptism External. And after all this, discharge all the rest from any Guilt or Punishment, or their being liable to it, because they had not committed the sins to confess, or had not strength of Nature, or Vollubility of Speech, or Boldness and Confidence to confess; and therefore never were to come to the Ministrations of <hi>John,</hi> to be of the Church of Christ. But more may be said of Confession, in answering that Objection.</p>

            <p>I Answer, Then they must grant some Infants to be there, as well as any other whatsoever; or else how could some of all Ages be there?

And if there had been any third sort, would not our Saviour have mentioned them? that had had the means sent to them, and yet had not accepted nor rejected? that had not justified God in accepting and being baptized, nor sinned in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the <hi>counsel of God against themselves, in not accepting, and being baptized:</hi> And could there be any in a third capacity among that people? that were the only people to whom it was then sent? when every one had as clear, full, express, and particular a call as any one whatsoever: and yet could there be any of a third sort that could refrain, and not come, and yet be innocent? Our Saviour mentioneth no third sort; and therefore we may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there was none. Besides, if there were a third sort here, under the Gospel, that might refuse to come and accept of Gospel-tenders, and yet be innocent, then we must conclude of a third place hereafter; for to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven they cannot go, because they did not, or do not come to Christ: And to He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now let us enquire a little further, What we are to understand by <hi>the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude?</hi> Which is another generall expression, used by the holy sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h them that were the subjects of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism, or they that were Baptized by <hi>John</hi> the Baptist.</p>
            <p>But before we enter upon the Scripture explication of this term, multitude, it will be necessary to answer a Cavil that is made by some, Against it; And that is, That it is not expresly said, that <hi>John</hi> Baptist did Baptize the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in Luke. 3.7. but that <hi>they came forth to be baptized of him;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore some say, that he did not Baptize the multitude. And I do not question, but they that can say this, can say a great many things as true as this, and with as much knowledg of the truth, and as much love to truth as this is said by them.</p>
            <p>I Answer, If <hi>John</hi> did not baptize the multitude, why did he charge them to bring forth fruit? The whole testimony of the two Evangelists must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42051:12"/> by such Souls, if they were not Baptised by <hi>John,</hi> that he charged, to bring forth fruit. Compare <hi>Matth.</hi> 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12. with Luke 3.7, 8, <hi>Bring Forth therefore fruits meet for repentance, Matth.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bring Forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance</hi> Luke 3.8. Therefore, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? If they had not been baptized, what obligation had they been under, more than what they had before?</p>
            <p>If they had been denyed the means of fruitfulness, how could they be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bring forth fruit? What shall the illative particle <hi>Therefore</hi> refer to? It would be good for such Persons to shew.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If <hi>John</hi> did not Baptize the multitude, then he did shut them out, and exclude them, from flying from wrath to come; And this he did not, but asked them, who warned them to flee from the wrath to come? And if this be compared with <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.7. It was spoken more particularly to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p n="3">3. Then The multitude must not be <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, or the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or be them that had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their father: And so <hi>Johns</hi> Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation must be in vain. And he must diswade them from trusting in that, which they had not, not were they capable of. All which is little less than blasphemy, <hi>John</hi> speaking as a prophet, by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If <hi>John</hi> did not Baptize the multitude, Then when he spake to them, the Ax was not laid to the root of the trees, when the holy Ghost doth say by <hi>John,</hi> that it was. And what Impudency such Sinners do shew, that can deny the very expressions of the holy Ghost, in Scripture; I leave all to Judge? com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10 with Luke. 3 9, And you may see That they may as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deny the Repo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Then <hi>Johns</hi> threatning them w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But a little further.

And if express Scripture will not satisfie any, that are given to wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Then they may wrangle on.

Or that did not appertain to it? Here was a multitude made up, of some of almost all Nations under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that we scarce ever read of the like in the whole Bible: And was it not the duty of them to repent, and be baptised that were spoken to, and did not; as well as it was their duty that did? If it was, then they were under the same Obligation, and Law of Divine Authority. And if not, then they did not sin that did not repent, and be baptised. Because they were under no Command. And if they of that multitude that did not repent and be baptised, did not sin, why does the Apostle condemn them as <hi>an untoward generation?</hi> verse 42. So Mat. 21 11. <hi>The multitude said this is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> &amp;c. verse. 15. <hi>When the Scribes and the Pharisees saw the wonderful things that he did, and the Children crying in the Temple,</hi> &amp;c.

The like discovery we have in <hi>Luke</hi> 19 38, 39. So that unless any will deny the Letter of Scripture; and the plainest Expressions of the Holy Ghost, that can set forth any thing, they must acknowledge that Children are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and intended by the multitude in Scripture, as well as the Adult. And that when <hi>John</hi> Baptised the Multitude, he baptised Infants as well, and as certainly as the Adult; and must, and ought so to do, because the Infants in <hi>Israel</hi> that were but a <hi>Span long,</hi> had God for their God as well, and upon the same ground, as to visible promise, as any Adult person whatsoever, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10, 15.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42051:14"/> of the Kingdom of Heaven, and a Doctrine discovering the <hi>Messias,</hi> that had been so long hoped for, now ready to be revealed. And a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of obtaining Remission of Sins, and of the Way for them to go to Christ, and believe on him, and being baptised with the Holy Ghost by him. Doubtless in conscience towards God, and in Obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they did, and must bring their Children with them to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>John.</hi> Deut. 31.11, 12, 13. Luke 5.1. <hi>The people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, and to be healed of their infirmities,</hi> and these were the multitudes that came to <hi>John</hi> to be baptized, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.18, 19, 24, 29, 30. <hi>For</hi> John <hi>was not then dead.</hi>

            <p>Besides our Saviour discovereth what a Spirit they were of, by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry: <hi>From the days of John the Baptist, the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence, and the violent took it by force,</hi> Mat. 11.10, 11, 12. So that it was a multitude gathered together to hear the word of God, and to be directed how to obtain the Kingdom of Heaven. And what spirit they were of, or are of, that would either neglect, or keep back their Children or Infants, let all that have any knowledge, or belief of the Kingdom of God, judge; and especially when all had it preached to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24.</p>
            <p>But that the Scriptural Interpretation of these general expressions, before explained, may appear to be true and genuine, according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning of the Holy Ghost in those expressions of <hi>Jerusalem, all Judea, all the Region round about Jordan, the multitude, and all the people.</hi> Let us view <hi>Johns</hi> Exhortation that he gave the people that he baptised; and that are set forth under these General Phrases and Expressions, and recorded in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.8, 9, 16, 17. compared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They were such as had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, and so were not admitted upon any other Terms, than as being the <hi>Children of Abraham.</hi> And if so All must be there, and were there, <hi>i. e.</hi> first or last, or else it was their grievous sin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. 2. They were such as had the priviledges of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, for else how should <hi>John</hi> have disswaded them, from trusting in their priviledges, as being the <hi>Children of Abraham?</hi> And if any one of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was there, and did partake of Baptism upon this account; it was their indispensable duty of every soul of them to be there, and to partake of it too, or else they were notorious transgressors, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. 3. They are spoken to in the capacity of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Children; in that <hi>John</hi> tells them, <hi>That God was able of the stones to raise up Children to Abraham.</hi> And if Infants and Children should have been excluded, why should he make mention to them of Children, and the Children of <hi>Abraham?</hi> 4. He asserts, <hi>That the Ax was laid to the Root of the Trees, that were to bring forth Fruit,</hi> and if every soul in <hi>Israel</hi> was not to bring forth good Fruit, that soul must be discharged from Christs Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or from hearkning to Christ; contrary to <hi>Acts</hi> 3 23. This Phrase of <hi>the Ax being laid to the Root of the Trees,</hi> comprehends both good and bad in <hi>Israel,</hi> for <hi>every Tree that did bring forth good Fruit,</hi> should stand, <hi>and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42051:15"/> not be cut down; and every Tree that did not bring forth good fruit, should be hewn down, and east into the fire.</hi> So that if there were any soul that was not here intended, that person must neither live nor die, neither stand nor be cut down, neither be kept out of the Fire, nor be cast into it; neither bring forth bad Fruit nor good Fruit, nor be Barren. 5. It is meant and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is comprehensive of <hi>all among the people</hi> that were to go to Christ; and had the promise of being <hi>baptised with the Holy Ghost,</hi> and that was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in <hi>Israel, Acts</hi> 2.38, 39, 40, 41. For they that did not accept are reckoned, and doomed as an <hi>untoward Generation.</hi> 6. His exhortation is comprehensive, and extensive of, and to all <hi>that were warned to flee from the wrath to come,</hi> Mat. 3.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.7. <hi>And that was all the people of Israel,</hi> Acts. 13.24 7. It was to all who were to <hi>walk in the way of the Lord,</hi> that <hi>John came to make strait and plain,</hi> Luke 3.5. If that did not concern the Old and Young <hi>of the Children of Abraham,</hi> let all judge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18 18, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. 8. His exhortation concerned All that were in the floor of that <hi>Visible Church; Christ would come, and throughly purge his Floor.</hi> 9 It was to All that were to be the Object of <hi>Christ's Fan, Mat.</hi> 3.12. And they were <hi>the Circumcision,</hi> which comprehended <hi>the Children of eight days old,</hi> and All others in <hi>Israel</hi> as in such a capacity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. 10 It concerned All that were <hi>Chaff</hi> or <hi>Wheat.</hi> 11. All that should be <hi>purged out,</hi> or <hi>continued in that Church of Christ.</hi> 12. It concerned All that should be <hi>damned or saved among that people,</hi> All that should be <hi>gathered into the garner as Wheat,</hi> and all that should be <hi>blown away, and burnt up as Chaff with the Fire unquenchable,</hi> Mat. 3.12. So that his Exhortation was comprehensive of <hi>all both good and had, old and young in Israel;</hi> which could never have been, if they had not been there, or have been required to be there by <hi>John</hi>'s being sent to all of them, and his Commission to Preach it, and Proffer it <hi>to every Soul of the seed of Israel,</hi> Acts 13.24.

               </gap>t hath been proved by the witness of the Spirit of God in Scripture, that the General Expressions before explained, do intend and comprehend
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42051:15"/> Infants as well as Adult; and that thereby we may be assured that Infants were baptized by <hi>John</hi> the Baptist as well as the Adult.</p>
            <p>Now let us enquire into one thing more, and that is, What ground or reason they had to be there; From <hi>John Baptist his Preaching of it to all the People of Israel,</hi> Acts 13.24. <hi>When John had first preached the Baptism of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to all the people of Israel</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> All that are here exempted from having it preached to them, must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from having it their duty to hearken to Christ. <hi>But every soul in Israel was under a command to hearken to Christ,</hi> Acts 3.23. Deut. 18 18, 19. Therefore there was no soul in <hi>Israel,</hi> or of <hi>Israel,</hi> but what was here in this Text intended to be spoken to, and to have it preached to them; <hi>In that every soul that did not hearken and obey was to be destroyed from among the people. John</hi> did not preach to more than he had commission to preach to, <hi>John</hi> 1.31, 33 The Infant that was but a <hi>span long</hi> was capable of entring into the Covenant with God, as well as the Adult, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 14, 15. And therefore must have all the means of imitation, or else be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and lose the good of the Covenant after they were taken, or had entred into it. And that Infinite Wisdom, Grace and Goodness that had taken them into it, did know how to convey the good of it to them, by the means he hath commanded them to wait upon him in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18, 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.15, 16, 17. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17.</p>
            <p>But some will say, it may be, <hi>How can any prove, That Infants of a few days old were here included, to be of the number that</hi> John <hi>Preached the Baptism of Repentance to?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answer,</hi> If all the people of <hi>Israel</hi> do not, according to the use of the Phrase by the Holy Ghost in Scripture, comprehend every soul in <hi>Israel,</hi> or of the seed of <hi>Israel,</hi> whether Adult or Infant, Male or Female, Poor and Rich, then it comprehended none. For one is no more expressed than another, nor no more particularly expressed than another. And if any will deny, they must deny all or none; and must grant all or none. And all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, by the same authority, and call, were to come as any one. And they be all preached to, as being all in one and the same capacity as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and that is, as they were of <hi>Israel,</hi> Rom. 9.6 <hi>All the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and that is, as they were the Seed, Off-spring, Issue and Natural Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> whom the Lord named <hi>Israel.</hi> And if it was preached to them, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this was God's way with this <hi>people of Israel,</hi> by <hi>John the Baptist.</hi> The good they were

So that here by <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>preaching this Baptism of Repentance to all the Children of Israel,</hi> they had every one a <hi>Call to be baptized,</hi> and every one a <hi>like Call,</hi> it being to all from the same Spirit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this to them in the same capacity, as <hi>the people of Israel,</hi> as <hi>the Children of the Promise,</hi> and as then the only Visible Church of God in the World; and by the Donation of God, to whom of Right it did belong, or appertain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Mat</hi> 15.24, 25, 26.

If it was not a Call, and a Warrant, then they sinned not that did not come to it But this is contrary to Christ's own Words, in <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30 and <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.31.32. And if not a Call, they that did come must come without Warrant; Nor could it be matter of Duty, but Will Worship. If it was a Call and a Warrant, it must be a Warrant and Call to All to whom it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But of that we read none, and therefore there was none, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.14. Therefore it must be God's Call to all that <hi>people of Israel.</hi> And this evidenceth that it was a Call, and that they had a Call, in that <hi>John</hi> asketh the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, who had warned them? Mat.</hi> 3 7. Particularly, they were not warned by any more than others.</p>
            <p>But it may chance, that some will have the word <hi>all</hi> to be <hi>some of all Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Ages and Conditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer then, it must be to Infants as well as to any; for they are some of that Age of Mankind. If any say, <hi>all the Elect,</hi> then it must include <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> too; for <hi>Election</hi> is not an act of Time, but from Eternity; and they that are not Elect when children, will never be Elect when Adult tho they may be then manifested to be such. If any say, it was <hi>all the called and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted only.</hi> Yet that does not exclude Children; for some have been called in <hi>Infancy;</hi> witness <hi>Isaac, Jacob, Sampson, Solomon, Jeremiah, John Baptist.</hi> And then the Elect uncalled must be excluded the means, and the call to it. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42051:17"/> say, <hi>all the Adult,</hi> then the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to the Fathers, must be broken and made void; and they must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Kingdom of God, that God had constituted of it; and that Christ afterwards asserted, that they were of the Kingdom of God, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, 14, 15. So that it must stand firm, and the thing be certain that they were to come being called; and that <hi>John</hi> ought to baptize them when he had called them to it, <hi>Acts</hi> 13 24. Whatsoever is, or was contained in the Law and the Prophets, is a Command, and so asserted by Christ himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37, 38, 39, 40. <hi>On these two commands hang all the Law and the Prophets:</hi> Verse 40. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; All that the Law and the Prophets spake, depended upon these two Commandments, <hi>Love to God, and our Neighbour.</hi> And if it did, then there was nothing contained in the Law and the Prophets but what contained a Command. And then what was prophesied of <hi>John, Mal.</hi> 4.6. and <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. was a Command to them to come to <hi>John,</hi> and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Ordinances from him; and a command to <hi>John</hi> to baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them, as well as the Prophecy, <hi>that Christ should be a Light to the Gentiles, Acts</hi> 13.47. And <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s preaching the <hi>Baptism of Repentance,</hi> to them; and the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven being at hand,</hi> must not contain <hi>Love to God,</hi> or <hi>our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi> or else it must be a command to them to come to his Baptism, and to repent of sin by Christ's own Testimony. So that if a Divine Command was a sufficient Warrant for them to come, and for <hi>John</hi> to baptize them; then they ought to come, and it was their Duty to come, and <hi>John</hi> ought to baptize them; as being commanded so to do; and to them to be baptized: And <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s asking of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who hath warned you to flee from Wrath to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7. does shew, that his preaching of this Baptism was a warning to the rest, tho not to them in particular, or only.</p>
            <p>But some have said, and doubtless will be ready still to say, <hi>What does this shew of the signification of the Expressions and Terms whereby the Subjects of</hi> John<hi>'s Baptism are set forth, or prove of Infants being baptized by</hi> John the Baptist? When it is expresly said, <hi>that they came to him to be baptized;</hi> and <hi>when they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, they confessed their sins;</hi> And neither of these Infants can do And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever Evidence can be given of Infants being intended by, and contained in the general Fxpressions from Scripture; yet all this is nothing in the Judgments of some, until these two Objections which are so visible to all, in the Texts, are answered. All that is said herein must go for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and be of no weight, to prove that <hi>John Baptist baptized Infants as well and as certainly as the Adult;</hi> altho the Youngest Infant in <hi>Israel had God for their God,</hi> as well as the Adult; and were as real in covenant with God, as to the External Means, as the Adult, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.1, 2, 10, 11.12. And altho the Promise was as express and as particular▪ and as sure to them as to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. Yet the infants must be excluded <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism in <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and from all Gospel-priviledges as Church-Members among the <hi>Jews,</hi> or in the Jewish Church, which was the only Visible Church of God then upon Earth; If these two things cannot be answered and removed out of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42051:18"/> the way. And because it is to clear up the Truth of God in his Promises made to the Fathers, that all Infants <hi>in Israel,</hi> or <hi>of Israel,</hi> were not then cut off from being Church Members, that God had made such, and so long continued to be such: And also, that they were not for ever after that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in <hi>Israel,</hi> and among the <hi>Jews,</hi> whether Embracers of the Gospel or not. It must needs be a matter of concernment for the Glory of God, and the good of Souls, to give Answers to these two things; and especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it will be a Foundation for Infants being admitted to Baptism in after-Ages.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore by God's assistance, first answer these two Objections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned; and then come to lay dawn Scripture-Argum nts and Reasons to confirm this, <hi>That</hi> John Baptist <hi>did as certainly baptize Infants as the Adult, and that be ought so to do.</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <head>A Scripture Answer to the Two Great Objections that have been, are, or may be made, or brought against, Infants being of the Number that <hi>John</hi> the Baptist Baptized, at his first Administration of that Ordinance to the Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Cavillations that are brought Against Infants being the subjects of Baptism at any time, by warrant of Scripture are Numerous. And I esteem all that is said against it, if not founded upon Gods Word, but as Cavils, and the Froth of mens own Brains, and Vain Imaginations. But if what is objected, have foundation in express Scripture, then it is to be Regarded, and Answered.</p>
               <p>Now there are two things that seem to make visibly against this Truth, in the apprehension of some; That <hi>John</hi> did not Baptize Infants as well as the Adult among them that he Baptized in the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> at his first Administration of Baptism.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In that it is recorded of them, that <hi>John</hi> Baptized. <hi>That they came forth to him,</hi> Luke 3.7. They that <hi>John</hi> Baptized were such as came to him. But Infants could not then come to <hi>John;</hi> therefore they were not, nor could not be of the number that he Baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They that <hi>John</hi> Baptized could, and did confess their sins, when they came to him; for they were <hi>Baptized in Jordan, confessing their sins,</hi> Mat. 3.6. But Infants could not confess their sins, therefore they were not, nor could not be of them that <hi>John</hi> the Baptist then Baptized.</p>
               <p>Now these two things, at the first view, seem to look as things Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble, and things unanswerable, against Infants being then Baptized by <hi>John</hi> the Baptist. And therefore many poor souls confidently conclude, That all Infants then were, and all others for ever after must be excluded the Visible Church, and denied the participation of the great Ordinance of Baptism, and means of Initiation, as having no right thereto.</p>
               <p>And this from their Impotency and Inabillity of Nature, because they were not able to come to the Ordinance at that time, by their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42051:18"/> and natural strength. And when they were come, not being able to speak and make a Verbal Confession of their sins; both these weaknesses or inabilities of nature, must exclude all Infants in <hi>Israel</hi> from being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to partake of Baptism, but they must be excluded from being Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Visible Church any longer; who were then, and at that time as real, and as expresly and particularly declared by God to be Members, and constituted, and sealed as such, as any of their Parents, or any other Adult person whatsoever, as to visible means, and visible owning. And also when they were declared from the Lord by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Word to be by God taken into Covenant, and had God for their God as any other in <hi>Israel,</hi> Deut. 29.10, to 16. And Infants must be excluded from having a right to be of them that <hi>John</hi> Baptized, when every Soul in <hi>Israel</hi> was bound by Divine Authority to hear that Prophet, that <hi>John</hi> was then sent as the Forerunner or Immediate Harbinger of, or else they must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed from among the people of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.27. Surely they do too little consider what they object against Infants being of them that <hi>John</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, or having right to be Baptized; when the Lord declares, that they must be destroyed if they were not there, and every soul of them that were not there. Surely they must have some right to be there, or some Divine Warrant, nay the same Warrant, that any else had, or else such a dreadful threatning could not have been denounced against them as well, and as justly, and righteously, as against any other persons whatsoever, in <hi>Israel.</hi> And also to exclude all and every Infant; when <hi>John</hi> the Baptist <hi>preached it to all Israel, or all the people of Israel,</hi> Acts 13 24. And when <hi>John</hi>'s Exhortation extended to all that were in that floor, and to every soul that should be by Christ shut out of Heaven or taken in, or gathered into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or cast into Hell. And yet there should be so many thousands in <hi>Israel</hi> at that very time, that had no right to be there, nor to be baptized; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not come to him upon their own personal feet, and by their own personal, and natural strength; or when they were come, they could not speak, and make confession of their sins. If they were not call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, they could not be saved, nor yet be rejectors to be damned. All that make or plead these Objections to exclude Infants in <hi>Israel</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the number that <hi>John</hi> the Baptist baptized in his first administration of it to <hi>Israel.</hi> Do by this declare plainly, That they esteem natural strength of body, and the power and ability of nature to use the legs, so as to travel for some considerable number of miles, and the natural ability to speak with the tongue, to be the necessary qualifications to capacitate a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or persons for Gospel Ordinance of Initiation, so as to be admitted a member of the Visible Church of God. And if any were not thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the use of their limbs to travel, and the use of their tongues to speak; then they must be discarded and excluded from being of them that are to be admitted visible Church Members, or from having any right or warrant to be of that number that have been admitted. For they are Reasons alledged or brought, to prove that Infants were not of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42051:19"/> that <hi>John</hi> the Baptist baptized, because they could not come to him, or his baptism. They that he baptized came to him, but Infants could not come to him. And they that he baptized confessed their sins; but Infants could not confess their sins, for they could not speak; therefore they were not there then. And because not then; never must any Infants have right to be there for ever after.</p>
               <p>And both these the going upon the feet natural and personal, and speaking with the tongue, are but natural endowments, and favours of the general goodness, and common providence of God, that he vouchsafeth to the Children of <hi>Adam.</hi> Yet it is made a necessary qualification for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the great Gospel Ordinance of Initiation, even Baptism. And all, and every person, that may be supposed to be without, or desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of these natural abilities must, and are supposed then, not to be of the number that <hi>John the Baptist</hi> baptized; and therefore all such must be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after excluded from Baptism.

Were it not for a supposed want of these <hi>natural Abilities,</hi> why might not <hi>Infants</hi> be there at <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, and partake of it, as any others in <hi>Israel?</hi> If <hi>Infants</hi> had these <hi>Endowments natural,</hi> to act and exercise them, then none could exclude <hi>Infants</hi> from being there, no more than any others: So that these <hi>natural Qualifications</hi> must be that which did qualifie them, and also they must be absolutely necessary; for they that can be supposed to want these, must most certainly be excluded from <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, and all <hi>Infants</hi> in after ages for ever, for their sakes, or because they were not supposed to be there for want of these things.

               <p>And if there is no need of grace, what need is there of the fountain of grace, And the purchase of grace, or of the Spirit and distributer of grace, and of the publishers of grace; and of any, or all of the means of grace? And what need is there of all or any of the end and effects of these thing? If Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural endowments will do, And if the use of the natural <hi>feet</hi> and <hi>tongue</hi> will quallifie, and be a sufficient quallification: Then the use of these must do more for any person than the endowments themselves; And so the effect must be better then the cause; For had not God fi st given the members of the body to any person, there could never be the use of them.

Where the Holy Ghost doth not express any such thing, nor so much as one tittle of it. If their confession was made to <hi>John,</hi> surely <hi>John</hi> did not very well like, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42051:20"/> approve of it, in that he called them a generation of Vipers, and so severely threatned them with speedy destruction in case they did not bring forth good Fruit; but never Absolved one Soul of them, or declared them to be in any other State by their confession one than another.</p>
               <p>And can men perceive or know whether any person have grace in truth in his or her Heart, by the vocal confession that is made by that person? If the grace in the Heart have been Infallibly discerned and known by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Mouth; Whence is it, that so many have been deceived? And whence is it, that the hearers of Confessions have been themselves adjudged to be graceless? And if any Mortal could Infallibly know the heart of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of himself either, How could it be the Prerogative Royal of God Almighty to search the Heart and try the Reins? <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10. How many years must a person Live, and what experience must he have before he do know what is in his own heart?

The Infusion, or way of the Communication of Grace is unknowable, and the manner of the growth of Grace is unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.26. So is the Kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground, and should sleep, and rise night and day; and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how; How should any make that out by a confession to men, that is so undiscernable; and if he in whom it is wrought may be for a long time unacquainted with it, how should others come infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly to know it, by a confession made by a person that hath it: And if it cannot certainly be known by a confession, how can the natural Ability to make the confession be a necessary qualification to make it known, in order to gain a right for Baptism?

And it is strange how any dare to put that in. But however, This sensible confession, respecting the manner of the confession, doth not only include natural abillity, but it includes Grace also, and excludes all from being of the Church of God, whatever of grace as well as nature they have, if they cannot make their confession sensibly; and it makes that a sensible acting of grace and nature, can gain that for us, that grace it self cannot gain, nor a confession neither, except it be sensible; and what sense this must be, and when exercised, who can tell? And where is the Warrant for this sensibleness in Nature, Kind and Measure, and how to be known? The want of a right manner of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If any thing of Nature in being, or act, can constitute us Members, or render us capable to be admitted Members, then there is no need of supernatural Grace for it. And if Grace, as a habit infused in the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Soul and Body united, constitutes one of the race of Mankind; and the actings of Soul and Body do but manifest that a person is of that kind. It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that grace should do any more for us, as to right, to gain it, or as to evidence of it, before God, at one time more than at another; howev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.20, 21, 22 Being in Christ, gives right to all. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 12.13, 14 <hi>&amp;c.

And tho there may not be the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal manifestation of this, as may be afterwards to the Subject, and to Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or fellow members. If true grace when wrought doth not, nor cannot unite a Person to Christ, and to the Church of Christ, which is his Body, can it ever do it? And if the habits, and the Divine Nature cannot, can the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of grace do it?

Then it should seem we must not make the Tree good, and his Fruit good. Let them that assert these things consider what they will make of the whole of Religion by these assertions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>John</hi> 13.1, 2. <hi>John</hi> 10.26, 27. <hi>John</hi> 15.5. If Grace, as received, cannot do it; can any thing of Nature do it? either of the abillity of it, or the actings of it?

               <p>But to come to speak of the Objections in particular. And the first thing objected is, <hi>That the Infants could not come to</hi> John <hi>to be baptized, And therefore they could not be Baptized by</hi> John <hi>the Baptist among them that he baptized.</hi> But this cannot be made a sufficient ground to prove that Infants were then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the Adult only were admitted to his Baptism; Or to prove that it was a coming by all that came, or ought to come upon their own personall, or naturall <hi>feet,</hi> and by their own personall, and naturall strength For then it must be asin in any to come any other wise than upon their own personall natural <hi>feet,</hi> and by their own natural strength, to publick worship, and to the assemblies publick and Sollemn And it must be a sin in any, to make use of outward means and creature advantages that God hath priveledged them with, to carry them to the service and worship of God, But it is no sin for them to make use of them to carry them to, and about their carnal business and affairs. Or else they must not use them at all, either of which will be strange; and if any adult person might make use of any creature to carry them to the service of God, might not the Infant have the same benefit as the Adult, If it was no sin in the Adult, but a prive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be carryed or born, to the publick assemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, could it be any sin to the Infant? and if any Adult parent might make use of any creature to carry them to the worship of God, why might not the Infant have the same priveledge especially considering that whatsoever parents have, they have it for, and ought to lay it out upon their children, and especially for the good of the Souls of children, to the furtherance of them in Gods service, and to <hi>breed them up in the Nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> and to bring them to the publick worship of God, and solemn assemblies; where <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that sucked the breasts,</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ought by the command of God to be, <hi>Joshua</hi> 8.3, 5. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.2, 3. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10.11.14 <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.10 11.12 And besides, this Imagination must make, that <hi>All the multitude,</hi> and <hi>all the Publicans and harlots</hi> were all strong and firm, and had none of them any bodily weakness upon them: Or else that they were all poor, and had no beast to carry them. And if this be brought to prove that Infants were not there, then it must not exclude all the Adult too that were not strong and firm, and able to come by their own naturall strength, and upon their own natural <hi>feet,</hi> And how many might that be, There must be none of the Adult, but such as were strong firm and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful only; For all the aged, weak and Infirm must be excluded from <hi>Johns Baptism,</hi> And denyed to have any right to be there, No more then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant; Because they could not come upon their natural <hi>feet,</hi> and by their own natural strength. They must not make use of any means to carry or bear, or bring them thither; For then they did not come And so must not be supposed to be there; Nor any for their sakes, ever after. The same
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42051:22"/> parity of Reason that excludes the Infant must and doth exclude the Adult. Nay, this Argument must make the fulfilling of the Prophesie to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and sinful; Which was, <hi>that they should bring their sons from far, Isay</hi> 60.9. And in <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.20. <hi>They shall bring all your brethren for an offering to the Lord, out of all nations, upon horses and in Chariots, and in litters, and upon Mules, and upon suift beasts, To my holy mountain Jerusalem,</hi> and they should be accepted when they were so brought; For the Lord doth premise in verse 12. <hi>That he will take of them for Priests and for Levites.</hi> Which sheweth that it referreth to the Gospel times; For <hi>Aaron</hi>'s priesthood was to continue till Christ did come. And this must make their <hi>flying as a cloud</hi> and, <hi>flocking as doves to the windows</hi> to be unawful. For that is <hi>upon the wings of the wind:</hi> And it makes <hi>Johns</hi> work of <hi>turning the hearts of the children,</hi> Imposible, If they must not be brought to him unless any can prove that <hi>John</hi> went from house to house. The land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and the <hi>Region round about,</hi> might be many miles distant from the places where <hi>John</hi> Baptized. And they might need the help of creatures to carry them; as may appear by Christs <hi>having compassion upon them that came from far, that they might not faint by the way. Matth.</hi> 14. <hi>Matth</hi> 15. And they could not have any Miraculous help, either as to food or help and strength as from <hi>John.</hi> Because he did no miracle, <hi>John</hi> 10.41.42. And it was in desert places where they could have no lodging if weary; nor sustenace if f faint; And therefore they did need beasts to carry them, and theirs away quickly to places of succour. And <hi>publicans</hi> and <hi>harlots</hi> do not use to be of the <hi>most moderate, abstenious tempers,</hi> but many of them have <hi>greedy and thirsty appetites after meat and drink.</hi> And therefore needed beasts, and helps to be quick in their motions to attain it.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="5">5. It could be meant of no other <hi>coming</hi> than what would consist with the express subjects of the promise. <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="6">6.

Acts.</hi> 19 3, 4. Now all that were excluded the means, must be discharged from being under any obligation to that end. 8 It must be such a <hi>coming</hi> as would consist with <hi>Jerusalem, All Judea, All the region, the Multitude,</hi> and <hi>all the people.</hi> All which expressions contain and comprehend <hi>men, women, and children. Matth.</hi> 14.21, 22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15, 38.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It must be understood of such a <hi>coming</hi> as would consist with the subjects of the threatning if they did not come, and that was <hi>every Soul in Israel, Acts</hi> 3.23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18, 19. It is said, <hi>That they came to him,</hi> But it is not said; <hi>that they came upon their own personal natural feet; and by their own personal natural strength.</hi> The Infants that were <hi>brought to Christ, Mark</hi> 10.13, 14, 15. that <hi>he took up in his Arms,</hi> are said <hi>to come;</hi> And Christ saith, <hi>suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not.</hi> And they be <hi>commanded to come,</hi> how else could any <hi>sin in forbidding of them?</hi> And yet how could they <hi>come,</hi> If not <hi>brought</hi> or <hi>carryed</hi> Many that are rich in the world, and live at some distance from the place of publick worship, and many that are of weakly constitutions, and Infirm bodies, <hi>come to the worship and service of God;</hi> and yet all call it a <hi>coming,</hi> though they are <hi>carried</hi> or <hi>brought. The blind and the lame</hi> are said to <hi>come</hi> to <hi>Christ in the, Temple,</hi> But it is not said <hi>that they came upon their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal feet,</hi> or <hi>by their own natural personal strength, Matth.</hi> 21, 14. <hi>Job was feet to the lame, and eyes to the blind, Job.</hi> 29, 15. They are far from <hi>Jobs</hi> mind that would have none have right to Gods ordinances but such as <hi>can come to it by their own naturall strength,</hi> and upon <hi>their own personall feet.</hi> Our saviour is said <hi>to come to Jerusalem;</hi> and yet <hi>he rode upon an Ass; Blessed be the King that cometh in the Name of the Lord, Matth.</hi> 31, <hi>Luke</hi> 19, 41, <hi>When he was come near, he beheld the city and wept over it:</hi> So that Christ is said to <hi>come,</hi> by God and man, and yet he did <hi>ride. Jer.</hi> 31 8, 9. <hi>The woman with child, and her that travelleth with child together they shall come,</hi> &amp;c. could this <hi>coming</hi> be with their <hi>own natural strenght,</hi> and upon their <hi>own personal feet,</hi> if their condition expressed be considered?

They are said, <hi>to come.</hi> See also <hi>Isa.</hi> 49 22. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.14, 15.</p>
               <p>From all which it is clear and evident, that there can be no just ground <hi>to exempt or exclude Infants from being of the Number that</hi> John <hi>baptized,</hi> because it is said, <hi>they came to him.</hi> The <hi>Infants in the Congregation of</hi> Israel <hi>came to the Wilderness of</hi> Zin, <hi>Numb</hi> 20.1. and yet they could <hi>go</hi> no more than now, by <hi>their own personal natural strength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the other <hi>Objection,</hi> what they are said to do when they were <hi>come,</hi> and were <hi>baptized; They confessed their sins. Children cannot,</hi> or <hi>could not confess their sins; therefore,</hi> say some, <hi>they were not; nor could they be of the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that</hi> John <hi>the Baptist baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this at the first sight seems to be unanswerable: and therefore it ought to have the more deliberate enquiry into, and the fuller Answer returned to it. But before I enter upon the Enquiry, or returning the Answer to it, I humbly conceive it will be necessary to premise some few things with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to <hi>Confession in general,</hi> that so the <hi>Confession in debate</hi> may be the better understood; and the whole Answer may have the more candid constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and acceptation. And 2dly, Premise something about the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Kind of the Confession</hi> that <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> could admit of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Matter in question is not about the Matter of Fact reported, <hi>whether there was a confession;</hi> for that is expresly written; but of what <hi>Kind or Nature this Confession was, whether Verbal or Moral?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not, <hi>whether any confession be lawful,</hi> but <hi>whether a Verbal confession be necessary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not <hi>whether this confession be lawful, and may be made by any,</hi> but <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this confession be absolutely necessary, and must be made by every one that is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, op ought to be baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Not <hi>whether a confession may be made to satisfie the Church of God, in case of Offence, by Scandal, that the person may be received in again;</hi> but <hi>whether it must be done by all, and every person that is baptized, to gain a right to be admitted to be a Member of the Visible Church of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The question is not, <hi>whether every Tongue is to confess to God,</hi> but <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it must be, and ought to be made to men at the participation of this Ordinance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Not <hi>whether the truth is to be owned before men, in case of persecution;</hi> but <hi>whether it must be done by all, and at all times, at the participation of this Ordinance, to have the enjoyment of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. It is not, <hi>whether there may be a publick owning of the Articles of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, when rehearsed by the Minister, at the time of the Administration of this Ordinance, to an Infant, by the Father, as a prudential Act of the Church of God, to satisfie the Congregation that it is not the Child of an Heathen, or of one that doth not own the Faith;</hi> but <hi>whether it must be done by the person, and every person to be baptized, as eommanded and imposed by Divine Authority?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:42051:23"/>8. Not <hi>whether every person ought to be a true penitent, to partake of the Internal benefits of Baptism, in a saving manner;</hi> but <hi>whether every one must be a true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and discover this to men too, to partake of the External Administration?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Not <hi>whether true penitency is required to make a person of the Invisible Church,</hi> but <hi>whether true penitency, and the making a discovery of this true penitency to men, is absolutely the duty of every person that is admitted to be a Member of the Visible Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 Not <hi>whether every Soul is to obey the Gospel that teacheth Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, in every act of Divine Worship, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ordinance;</hi> but <hi>whether every Soul that is baptized, must make certain discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by a Verbal confession before men, of their Faith and Repentance, before ever they ought to be admitted to be Visible Disciples?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Not <hi>whether a person is to make a prudential confession to be a Member of such or such a particular Congregation, and with them parta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e of all Ordinances and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges at all times, and of all kinds;</hi> but <hi>whether every person is by a verbal confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make out the truth of his or her Faith, before they shall be baptized into the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. It is, <hi>whether indeed our Verbal Confession is that which doth give the right to Baptism?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would premise some few things with respect to this <hi>Confessi n</hi> that was made by this People of <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> or rather at <hi>the time of their baptizing;</hi> That it may be known <hi>what Confession</hi> John Baptist <hi>could admit of at his Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We are not to believe any other <hi>confession</hi> here intended than what was consistent with the Promise and Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be <hi>their God, and they to be his visible people.</hi> So that it must give no right to the <hi>par icipation of the Ordinance;</hi> for then the Promise and Covenant must be put an end to and they must have no right by them.</p>
               <p>And <hi>secondly,</hi> All they that could not confess for want of Speech, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or not having committed the sins confessed, or through any other cause, must be <hi>cut off from the promise,</hi> which is contrary to the express Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.55 72, 73. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38 39. <hi>Rom</hi> 9.4, 5. <hi>The Infants a span long had God for their God,</hi> as well as any other person in <hi>Israel, Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11.14, 15, 16. And there could be no confession, so as to destroy, or make void this Right of the Covenant, that was by free donation from God to <hi>all the Seed of Abraham, Deut.</hi> 10 15. The <hi>Seed of Abraham,</hi> and all the <hi>people of Israel,</hi> were the Objects of <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry; and that was every Soul <hi>in Israel,</hi> or <hi>of Israel.</hi> Compare <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10 11, to 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23.</p>

                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:42051:24"/>3. It cannot be understood with respect to any other confession, either as to Nature, Matter and Effect, than what should consist with their Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and with their having and enjoying their Priviledges by being of the <hi>Seed of Abraham,</hi> for that they had and did enjoy even in baptism; for <hi>John</hi> advised them not to te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Besides, If <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Posterity was all looked upon, as in their Blood, and were all Dag from the same Pit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 3, 4, to 12. and <hi>Isai.</hi> 51.2, 3. Then the matter of the Covenant must be the same, as to kind. And that was Life as they were Dead, Forgiveness and Pardon as Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Purging and Washing as Filthy, Cloathing as Naked, and pouring out his Spirit upon them as dry Bones, or else they could not have what they wanted as a suitable remedy. And for the manner of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon God's part as free, and of his own Grace and Love and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it upon their part, as undone and unworthy Creatures; or else they could never have i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And if they had been worse, it would not have served their turn, or supplied their wants. So that upon all hands, there had been no place for the matter, and message of the Gospel to that People, to whom they were sent, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>Isa.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p>And should they have come for admission to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, as qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons, in nature or action, they must have been uncapable of admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to a promise of Free Grace, and Life in a time of Love, and much less to the Seal of it.</p>
               <p>As this confession could not be a necessary duty upon the account of the Alteration of the Covenant, or Promise in it self. No more could it be a necessary duty upon the account of the alteration of the Dispensation of it, or means of conveyance. An Alteration of the Dispensation of the Covenant, had been before in several Generations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>And it is certain, that when <hi>John</hi> came, there was to be a fresh, or new Dispensation of the Covenant; <hi>For he was to make strait and plain the way of the Lord,</hi> and to look to Christ, with more clearness, and make clearer discoveries of Christ. The Ceremonies were all shortly to cease, and the Vail to be taken away; and Christ, who wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to fulfil all things, written

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orth Christ to come, were to cease; and all things to be set forth, as now ready, and the Dispensation to be the clearest that ever was, or should be, as to the means setting of it forth.</p>
               <p>It is called <hi>the day spring visiting of us,</hi> Luke 1. And <hi>the Light coming into the World,</hi> John 3.19, 20, 21. <hi>The day of Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>And the last wherein God doth speak to us by his Son,</hi> Heb. 1.1, 2, 3. Mat. 21.27.</p>
               <p>And this calleth for the readier, and fuller acceptation at the hands of sinners, higher estimation of it, and care and Conscience to lay hold upon it, lest at any time they should let it slip, and to walk worthy of it. And it renders the condition of all <hi>that reject it, the more inexcusable and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and intolerably lost, and undone,</hi> Mat. 11.20, to 25. Heb. 2.3.</p>
               <p>But it did not render the Condit on of those that had it rendred to them, by the clearness of the discovery, better than it was before, or require more in them, than was required before, in order to the acceptation of it, and the admission to the external means thereof. But it did rather disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mans vileness, and unworthiness, and his own impotency to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and the insuffiency of all things to help him. And required the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation of all confidence in the flesh, or whatsoever he had or did, as <hi>dung</hi> and <hi>dross,</hi> and to bring him to renounce all priviledges. <hi>Say not within your selves, we have Abraham to our Father,</hi> Luke 14.33. Phil. 3.5 6, 7. Luke 18.10, 11, 12. Luke 15.17. Mat. 15.27. Rev. 3.15, 16, 17, 18. Luke 4.18.</p>
               <p>If the Dispensations of the Grace are clear, then of necessity there must be a clearer discovery made of the evil of sin, and of mans undone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by it, both as to the loss of good, and the suffering of evil, being all under sin, and shut up in unbelief, and the whole World lying in wickedness, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. And the Worlds enmity against the Lord Jesus as a Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 7.7. And our Captivity to the Devil, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. Ephes. 2.1, 2 3. <hi>And our carnal mind to be enmity against God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. Col. 1.21.</p>
               <p>And if it were not so, what necessity would there be of the things of Christ? Both as to the kind, variety and fulness of his Grace, and as to the necessity, excellency and suitableness of all the means and ways of conveyance of it? And what worth could there be in these things, above all things in the World to a poor sinner? and one day of the enjoyment, or the attainment of these to be worth a thousand elsewhere? Were it not for the discovery made of the sinners lost and undone condition, and his woful helplesness in himself. And <hi>that there is help in none other, under Heaven,</hi> Acts 4.12. And what condemnation could there be for the sinners non acceptance of the Grace of God in Christ, if it were not clearly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that he did want it, and he everlastingly to be undone without it? <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. <hi>John</hi> 8.23, 24.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42051:28"/>
               <p>The time of Love, and the day of Salvation does most clearly discover man to be in his Blood, and no Eye to pity him; and therefore the change of the dispensation could not make the confession to be a duty, and a duty of that necessity, that there was no participation without it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Confession be granted to be of another Nature than to discover our good Qualifications, and as able to make a Discovery of our Goodness: For if we have it already, then we cannot receive it from Christ, nor need we come to Christ for it: Nor can what we have give us a Right to it.</p>
               <p>But that we may be further satisfied about this confession, it is best to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a little further into it; both as to the Original Text, and the Nature of the Thing.</p>

               <p>Now from the <hi>acceptation</hi> of the word in this and other Texts, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, That if it had been a Confession with an audible Voice, yet it must not concern children, nor any other Adult Persons, that had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted these Notorious Crimes; For they that had not done the deeds that they had, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.18, 19. could not confess them.</p>
               <p>And if all must be exempt from <hi>Baptism,</hi> that did not <hi>confess Notorious Crimes,</hi> then not only Children, but all Adult Persons must be exempted also, that had not committed these Crimes. For who could make such a confession, unless he had committed them? Except a Person must falsly accuse himself. And was that a work for the admission to so solemn a Duty, so as to gain a Right to partake of it? So that if any would exempt Children from Baptism, for not confessing their actual Fau ts, or notorious Crimes, they must exempt th m first of all for not committing of them, or not being guilty of them: And by how much younger any Child is, by so much the less is he capable of commttting them, and so much the more uncapable of confessing of them.</p>
               <p>And if such a confession doth qualifie for Baptism, such practices, wherein, or whereby they may be, or are committed, must qualifie prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; that so they may confess them.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42051:28"/>
               <p>And besides what is here in the acceptation of the Word, to shew their Repentance, or the Truth of their Repentance, in the acknowledging they had committed such Crim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nor could the bare confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins discover, and make out Evidences to any of the Truth of their Grace of Repentance.

               <p>And the Word in the Text must be understood so <hi>to import a confession by practice as well as by words:</hi> Or else how will any be able to understand that Text in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. where it is u ed <gap reason="foreign">

And if any say, it shall be in Eternity; then they must prove, that the Command doth not respect time; and that no more for one than another. But however; the Babes did this in <hi>Matthew</hi> 21.15.</p>
               <p>Or else they must make, that the glorifying of God for Christ, is in Tongue, and in Words only; and that the Life and Practice is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to his Glory.

Where they be prophesied of to be Agents in this Work▪ And Christ himself doth so interpret it, <hi>Matthew</hi> 21.15.</p>
               <p>And they must exclude Children from being of the Number that <hi>John</hi> was <hi>to turn to the Lord their God:</hi> Compare <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11. with <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. God is their God, that they are capable of, and were Subjects of in <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or else prove, That Baptism was no Means to turn them to the Lord, or of bringing them to Christ; and so gain-say the declared End of <hi>John</hi> in Baptising, which was, that they should <hi>beli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First as to the warrant for it, whether there be any command of God requiring of it by <hi>John Baptist,</hi> or in the least intimating of it to them from the Lord; And as to the warrant for it, the Word of God is totally silent, so as to warrant this Act of theirs at this time, or to require such a Verbal confession at this time; much less so as to gain a right to Baptism by it. And if not commanded, it could not be a Sin to omit it, nor could there be such a punishment inflicted for the want of abillity to perform it, as to exclude so many thousands of Infants, that might be then in <hi>Israel</hi> and real members of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, from Baptism, or from being of the visible Church of God any longer, and in them and with them all Infants ever after. <hi>John</hi> came preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Baptism of Repentance for the Remission of Sins, to all the People of <hi>Israel, Acts</hi> 3.24. But it is not said the Baptism of Repentance, and Remission, for such only as did Verbally confess their Sins, to make out that they had repented of them. It is true, confession is a part of Repentance; But it is no more a part, than Conviction, Humiliation, and Reformation are, if it be so much as one of these. For there may be a Verbal confession, and yet the Soul have none of the other parts of Repentance. And so the Repentance may be no Repentance. This is clear, that there is no Word of God requiring of it in particular, and therefore such stress can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be laid upon it, as to be made the qualification absolutely necessary for Baptism. 2. If any should say, that it was a custom they had among the <hi>Jews,</hi> that when they purified their Hands, they confessed their Sins? I answer, then that could make it no cause of Exemption of all from Baptism that did not do it, nor be a rule ever after, Nor give them a right to Baptism. Or 3. Whether any remorse of conscience raised by <hi>Johns</hi> sharp threatnings was the cause thereof, and made them, or some of them to cry out like them in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>What shall we do to be saved. Johns</hi> Ministry, and administrations, had a mighty convincing efficacy with it; as appears from <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.10, 11. Though the Pharisees said he had a Devil. That horrour was the cause, see Luke 3.8, 9, 10. <hi>Then said</hi> John <hi>to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him. O Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore Fruits worthy of Repentance:</hi> and begin not to say within your selves, we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father, for I say unto you that God is able of these Stones to raise up Children to <hi>Abraham; And now also the Ax is laid to the Root of the Trees: Every Tree therefore that bringeth not forth good Fruit is hewn down, and cast into the Fire.</hi> And the People asked him what shall we do then? Hear these Words, <hi>what shall we do then</hi>

                  </gap> do shew that they were under great dread of what would come upon them, and of their being lyable to this wrath; like them in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. And the Goalor <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31. And there is a serious confession of a Sense of their guilt, and of their misery, and of their Impotency and Inabillity to get out of themselves. And <hi>John</hi> bids them shew mercy, if they would find mercy; which was that which <hi>Zacheus</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8, 9, 10. He doth not bid them be baptized: Because they were Baptized before, Which appears in that he told them the Ax was laid to the Root of the Trees, and disswades them from trusting in their priveledges, and perswades, and chargeth them to bring forth good Fruit; and directs them in the practice of Repentance. And if this was the cause of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; This made no full change upon their state that did thus cry out, nor discharged any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from their duty to be Baptised. For when they asked <hi>Peter,</hi> what shall us do? <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. He said, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you;</hi> and it was the duty of them in that Congreg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have repented, and to have been baptized that did not, as well as theirs that did, but the Words of <hi>Peter</hi> did shew that he did not look upon them, then as penitents, and yet they were baptized the same day. And if this made no change upon their, state though it were after Baptism, it could not be a ground to exclude all others from Baptism. And if this confession was raised by this dread that seized upon their Spirits, there was the more ground to believe that Children were baptized. For when <hi>Jacob</hi> was in fear of danger about <hi>Esau,</hi> he feared what would become of Mother and Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. and used means for their preservation; and if their confession was raised by this, and after Baptism, then this was not a deliberate confession to shew the truth of their Repentance, and so to gain a right to Baptism; nor could it be of such concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to exclude all that had it not from any right to Baptism, for then the Pharisees and Lawyers could not have been guilty of such Sin, in their not being baptized of <hi>John, Luke</hi> 7.32. But it must have been for not confessing, that so they might have had a right to it. There was no object of the confession, if this Interpretation be denied. It is said the people asked him, what shall we do then, and whether it were some for all, or every individual, who can tell? And if the Adult did speak and the Children could not, were not the Parents to take care that they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42051:30"/> might have the means to flie from the wrath to come as well as themselves? And to be taught to take Gods way as well as themselves? it being after Baptism, and was there any question to be made but they would take care about this, if they were truly awakened? And especially when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Childrens names were as expresly in <hi>Johns</hi> Commission as the Parents? And if they did not take care about them, was it not their Sin? And their grievous Sin too? against the express declared will of God concerning their Children, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.6. If he that provideth not for the Bodies of Children hath denied the faith, and is worse than an Infidel 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. What notorious Monsters had these People been if when they were awakened to see the wrath of God, in the Fire of Hell coming in upon them should not take care that it might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from their Children as well as from themselves? And this when God had provided means for their Children as well as for them? even for every Soul in <hi>Israel. Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.13, 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. This would have made them worse than some of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to their Servants and Cattel which were not so near as Children, <hi>Exod</hi> 9.20.</p>
               <p>Secondly having viewed the confession as to the Efficient cause, and found upon that account no cause in it, to exclude Children, then, and much less ever after from Baptism. Let us now view it as to the material cause, and that is as to the matter of it. And that the Text expresseth was their Sins, not their Graces, either of Faith or Repentance, and neither of these could be in them in truth alone or one without the other, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> And Criticks in the Greek language tell us that this <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not taken for any kind of fault, but for some grievous crime. And if it be so to be taken here, then the not making a confession of these, could in no wise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt those that were not guilty of these grievous crimes from Baptisme: For then they must be guilty, of those grievous crimes that they might confess them, or falsly accuse themselves, and make a false confession, as to matter of Fact; Or else be excluded the Church of God, whether they were Adult or Infants, and this when God had made them of it before. Now for any to affirm this would be strange, that Baptism was only provided for, and to be administred to such only who had committed grievous crimes, or only to such who had been grievous criminals upon a Verbal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of these crimes. And there is nothing said in the Snripture that it was to shew their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them, or to evidence the truth of their repentance. And who could tell that they had or did repent truly? When they confessed their crimes? However this is clear from the Word of God, both in this place and in other places, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.18. <hi>James</hi> 5.16. That it respects actual trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and if so, then not being able to confess these, not having committed them, could be no just ground to exclude any from Baptism. Much less all Children then, and for ever after.</p>
               <p>Some would have that when this Word hath the Article joyned with it, it is to be taken to signifie our Hereditary disease, or Original Sin: And so it hath here in this text <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and if any will have it to have this signification here, then it cannot be taken to signifie any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Enumeration of their Sins. For who can understand that mystery of iniquity? <hi>Psalm.</hi> 19.12.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10. and if it cannot be known, can it be confessed? But why should it be a confession of that! If Man were not a lost creature what need a Saviour, and what need any promise? or any Ordinance? or Messenger sent to turn poor Sinners from their Sins? and if all were nor filthy what need a Washing? and if they had confessed that in never so general terms, as <hi>Peter Luke</hi> 5.7. <hi>Job</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 40.4. <hi>Isaiah.</hi> In <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.9.64, 6, 7.8. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 7.18. to 25. could they be contented their Children should perish in this condition? and this when God had so declared his kindness to their Children as the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and had promised their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to the Lord by the same means that he had their Parents? <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. But however men observe the Word to signify with the article or without it. Yet the Words of <hi>John</hi> Baptist to them carrieth the meaning of it to be with respect to their actual Sins, in that he called them a generation of Vipers, that were Pharisees and Sadduces, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7. and their lives had discovered to themselves, and to all others, what they were by nature. Or was the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral state of any one of them to be questioned when it was so discovered by <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 6.5. and by the Prophets, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9.10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.4, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51.1, 2, 3. <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. 3. as to the formal cause, whether it was according to the rule of the Word that it was performed in? When there was no command requiring of it? The Prophets h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Or in such a way and manner as a true confession is required to be in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 6.9. The Scripture is wholly silent as to any discovery of the truth of the repentance of this Multitude though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42051:30"/> a confession of Sins, as to matter of fact; and this without any difference in any of them. Now where there is nothing of a discovery of any thing that is recorded; to be done according to rule, how can there be any punishment inflicted upon any because they did not, or were not able to do the same matter of fact? as to be cast out of the Church of God, when God had put them in: and all others to be excluded from being of it, for default in this confession, though it were by inability of Nature, or Innocency of practice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the final cause the end of it, whether it was to declare the truth of their repentance, or to give glory to God, or to satisfie <hi>John</hi> Baptist, or to obtain a right to the Ordinance? If this be taken to declare the truth of their repentance, as some would have it to be; Because they say there must none but true penitents be baptized. Because they say these were all true penitents that <hi>John</hi> baptized, in that they confessed their Sins. I answer if their confession was a confession of true penitents; Then this repentance was wrought in them, before the Holy Ghost was poured upon them, or before they were baptized with the Holy Ghost by Christ. And how could that be? But if any object and say that the baptizing with the Holy Ghost signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the extraordinary gift of Tongues, and working of miracles. I answer that baptizing with the Holy Ghost do sometimes import the gift of miracles, and speaking with Tongues in the New Testament as Acts 1.5. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3.4. But that it doth so signifie when <hi>John</hi> said to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, He shall Baptize you with the Holy Ghost, cannot be proved. For then it must make, that the gifts of speaking with divers kinds of Tongues, in an extraordinary manner. And the working of miracles was the only inward Baptism in the Primitive times that was signified by the Baptism with water. And then it must be so still, For it cannot signifie more now then it did then, and when miracles ceased, then Baptism with water ceased or must cease. And that by these gifts they were baptized into Christ, and put on Christ 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. <hi>see</hi> 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 3.21. This is to make all the Multitude to be workers of miracles, and speakers with Tongues, and so there must be none that should have miracles done upon them, but such as were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized or to be baptized. 3. Then the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> joy must be, that he had power to work miracles <hi>Acts</hi> 8.39, &amp;c. 4. This is contrary to what is promised as the effect of Baptism <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. And asserted as the thing signified, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.21. 5. Then their believing in Christ, which was the end and design of <hi>J hn</hi> in Baptizing them with water, to bring them to, must not be a saving Faith, but a Faith of Miracles, <hi>Act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> that? <hi>Luke</hi> 1.16. But a little further to prove that these words of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist to the multitude <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. So <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16. is not to be understood of the power of working of Miracles, or speaking with Tongues. But the saving work of Grace upon the Souls of poor Sinners. And to make this appear first, I shall give some Texts of Scripture; and the first Text I shall offer to prove this Truth is in <hi>John</hi> 3.3.5. The words of Christ to Nicodemus the Pharisee, who were such as neglected the outward means of Baptism, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. And our Saviour does assure him with verily, verily, that without the External means and the Internal benefit, or without the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal benefit with the External means, no one that had the offer and did slight it, should see the Kingdom of God. So in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44, 45, 47. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 11.16, 17, 18. The whole assembly do conclude that repentance unto life was granted to the Gentiles. And <hi>Peter</hi> saith that God purified their Hearts by Faith. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. So 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.21. The inward Spiritual benefit signified by the outward means is there asserted to be the answer of a good conscience through the Resurrection of Jesus Christ; so also 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.8, 9. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. Arise and be baptized, and wash away thy Sins calling upon the name of the Lord. So that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing with the Holy Ghost in the Primitive times did not only signify the gift of miracles, and speaking with Tongues, but saving grace. This may be further confirmed from <hi>Johns</hi> Words in that he charged them to bring forth good Fruit, and if not, he threatned them with being turned into Hell as Chaff. Now Miracles, and Tongues do not, nor were not then, the distinguishing characters between Chaff and Wheat, good and bad. 2. This would argue that them that <hi>John</hi> baptized were true penitents, which is contrary to Christs own words <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.2, 7, 16, to 25. compared. 3. Then they must have special grace to make a confession, that they might have right to Baptism, that they might be partakers of common gifts of the Spirit. 4. Then common gifts must be the Seal to the special Grace. 5. Then the Fruit they were to bring forth of Baptism was to work Miracles. And speak divers languages. 6. Then <hi>John</hi> baptized them, to do, or to gain that which he had not himself for he did no Miracle, <hi>John</hi> 10.41. 7. This contradicts <hi>John</hi> Baptists advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.11, 12, 13, 14, 8. Then all the People all <hi>Judea, Jerusalem,</hi> all the Region
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42051:31"/> round about <hi>Jordan.</hi> And the multitude must be all workers of Miracles; and speak with divers kinds of Tongues.</p>
               <p>But after this Evasion is evaded, to prove them that <hi>John</hi> baptized were not true penitents, because the baptizing with the Holy Ghost doth, signifie sometimes the gift of Tongues, and the working of Miracles. Let us see what may be said or produced farther from Scripture, to prove that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was not to declare them true penitents, or the Truth of their repentance; Or that this did not evidence they were true penitents. And this may be first cleared by many express Texts of Scripture. The first is in <hi>John</hi> 3.31, 32, 33. from <hi>John</hi> Baptists own Mouth. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from above, is above all, he that is of the Earth is Earthly, and speaketh of the Earth, he that cometh from Heaven is above all; and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth, and no Man receiveth his Testimony. That <hi>Johns</hi> Testimony in his Baptism was from Heaven is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by Christ <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25.32. &amp;c. If any will have this to be spoken of Christ, then it is much more true of <hi>John,</hi> that they did not believe and repent by his Testimony, for if no Man received Christs Testimony that came after, then they did not receive the Testimony of <hi>John</hi> that went before. 2. It may be proved from <hi>John</hi> the Baptists Exhortation to them, that they were not true penitents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9, 10, 12. If it were before Baptism, that he gave them this Exhortation, Then it sheweth that he spake to all the People; all that were in the Floor of that Church: and to all that were members there in, as not true penitents; And yet as them that had right to be baptized, and was to be baptized Immediately. If the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was after Baptism, then it sheweth that he did not look upon them after Baptism better than what they were before baptized. Such as were as Trees in Gods Field, but if they did not bring forth good Fruit should most certainly be cut down <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9, 10, 12. I humbly conceive that this Exhortation was given to them after he had baptized them; and my reasons are these. First, in that he exhorted them to bring forth Fruit. Now if their duty was Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, then they had the means by which they were obliged thereto, and enabled thereto as to the means of conveyance. 2. In that <hi>John</hi> doth acknowledg to them, that he had baptized them with water. 3. In that he makes a promise, or declares the promise, that Christ should Baptize them with the Holy Ghost: Which could not have been declared to them, as a motive, but as the success of the ordinance, not as to prevail with them to do the duty of the external means, but a promise of the internal good and benefit that God would succeed it with, if they did go to him for it. 4. In that he was to set forth Christ to them that did accept of the means by him, and the evil of their case that did slight the means. 5. In that he speaks to them as they that had fled from the wrath to come, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7. 6. In that he dehorteth them not to trust in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; which sheweth they had the enjoyment of them, in the participation of the means. 7. In that he saith the Ax was laid to the Root of the Trees, and every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit is hewn down. Which could never be pronounced of them that had not had the means. For then it must be alike evil with them that have, and are unprofitable under it, contrary to <hi>Matth,</hi> 11.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. 8. <hi>In that they were now the Objects of Christs Fan.</hi> Next, 9. <hi>In that he should purge them out, which showeth that</hi> John <hi>had took them in and admitted them.</hi> 10. <hi>In that he gave them directions for their present work, Luke</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12, &amp;c. And to prove, that they were not all true penitents before, is clear from various Texts of Scripture, and from good Reasons grounded upon Scripture. <hi>The first Text is in</hi> Matth. 9.7. <hi>And</hi> Luke 3.7. <hi>In that</hi> John <hi>called them a Generation of vipers. Which title is never given to any that were true penitents in Scripture, See</hi> Matth. 23.33. 2.

When they cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So that, that Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not all true penitents. 6. Another Text is in <hi>John.</hi> 10.40, 41, 42. Where they are said to believe in Christ afterwards; and then they were not true penitents, nor could be while unbelievers 7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13.14. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.16. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Luke.</hi> 13.23. Where our Lord Jesus declares that there are few that shall be saved.

Where it is said that God had raised up his Son, sent him to bless them, in turning every one of them from their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42051:32"/> Now if they had been turned before, then Christ could not have done that Work that he was sent by the Father to do for them. 9. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.23. compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35, 36.37. The threatnings that Christ would leave their Houses desolate, and every Soul that did not hear him should be destroyed. And that they should die in their Sins, <hi>John.</hi> 8, 24. Had they been true penitents, all must have been saved and none of them destroyed. 10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.39, 40, 41, 42. Where they are called an evil and Adulterous Generation, and the Pharisees and Lawyers were not the Generation. The Queen of the South, and the Men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> should rise up in the Judgment with that Generation, and should condemn it; for that the Men of <hi>Nineveh</hi> repented at the Preaching of <hi>Jonah,</hi> but they did not, though a greater than <hi>Jonah</hi> was there. 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.44.45. Our Lord Jesus does threaten them that seven worse Spirits should enter into that wicked Generation. 12. <hi>Luke.</hi> 4.16, to, 28, 29.30. <hi>Nazareth</hi> which was one of the Cities in <hi>Gallilee,</hi> who were some of the Region round about <hi>Jordan.</hi> The People there were so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent that they would have broken the neck of the Lord Jesus Christ for the close Sermon he preached to them. Which I think was evidence sufficient of their Impenitency. See also <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16, 17, to, 25. And besides these Texts of Scripture we may have good reasons grounded upon Scripture, that all that <hi>John</hi> Baptised were not true penitents. First because then there must be no visible Church consisting of good and bad, contrary to what our Lord Jesus doe discover of the visible Church on Earth. <hi>John.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.47, 48. It is compared to a Net that had bad and good Fish in it, and a Sown Field that has Tares as well as Wheat, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.37, 38, 39, 40. So <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. It is a great House where are not only Vessels of Gold, but of Wood and of Earth, and some to Honour, and some to Dishonour. And the Floor in which <hi>John</hi> Administred Baptism; had Chaff and Wheat in it that should be severed by Christ alone in his time. 2. Because then the whole multitude, and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and all <hi>Judea,</hi> and a l the Region round about <hi>Jordan</hi> must be all true penitents, which is contrary to the express Testimony of Scripture concerning them. 3. Then they must be in the Kingdom of God before Christ came. Or was manifested, and could not press into it, nor take it by violence afterwards, contrary to <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.10, 11. 4. If they had been true penitents they must have renounced all their former false trusts, and dependances as other true penitent <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.23, 24, 25. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.37.

For the fury of the Lord is ceased as to true penitents <hi>Isa.</hi> 27, 4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. They are fled for refuge allready. 7. If Only true penitents were, and were to be Bap ized by <hi>John.</hi> Then all Impenitent Persons that were not then Baptized must have been discharged from Sin; as to that particular duty, <hi>hic &amp; nunc.</hi> For they must first have repented, and so the Pharisees and Lawyers must be innocent though they were not Baptized, at that time or in the places where <hi>John</hi> was Baptizing; which to say is to gainsay what Christ chargeth them with <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. But certainly it was their Duty to have been Baptized then by <hi>John.</hi> From our Saviours commending that, as a justifying of God in the Subjection to it, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.28, 29. And it was a Duty in that it was a way wherein they were to be prepared for Christs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, and for their coming to Christ and Believing in Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.4. And of Receiving from Christ <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. And therefore their Duty then, and at that time and in that place. Three thousand were Baptized the same day, though they were but then spoken to, to repent 8. Besides in the Confession we have not so much as one word to Discover any thing of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the Confession, or the Truth of their penitency, here is a Record of their Confession of their Sins, but not of their Grace, nor of the Truth of their Grace, <hi>Pharoah</hi> said he had Sinned, and <hi>Judas,</hi> but neither discovered their Grace thereby, nor the Truth of their Grace. If all that be Recorded in Scripture to make Confession of Sins must be reckoned to be true penitents, then Persons now must conclude them true penitents that Gods Word do not account so, Witness <hi>Achan Joshua</hi> 7. 9. And their enquiring of what they were to do, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.9, 10. Do shew that they were not true penitents. For this enquiring must be made by all the People, or by some only. If it was made by all, then they were all Ignorant. If it was made by some only; then they that did not enquire must be more Ignorant than they that did. For all were grievously Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant under the Ministry of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42051:32"/> obstructed, for that was that they mighr believe in Christ that was to come, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.4. So that unless any can prove that true Repentance may be without true Faith, they can never prove, that all they that <hi>John</hi> Baptized were true penitents. 11. If they were true penitents, then the fan in Christs Hand must be against true penitents, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. 12. Then either none must be purged out of that Floor, or else only true penitents must be purged out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. 13. Then the constitution of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was by God Immediately of <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his natural seed, must not be rightly constituted, but must and was rectified by <hi>John,</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. All were not good that were of <hi>Israel,</hi> no more were all really good, that were of <hi>Isaac. For</hi> Jacob <hi>was beloved and</hi> Esau <hi>not beloved: And yet God said, In</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy Seed be called,</hi> Gen. 17.19.20.4. 14. <hi>Johns</hi> exclusion of those <hi>Jews</hi> that are Imagined to be excluded, for not confessing must be by unparallell'd Prorogative Power, and Lordly Dominion, for there is not one w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And who can believe that <hi>John</hi> would do this? when he was come on purpose to direct them in the most directest, and plainest manner to Christ: and to leave them to stand or fall before his Fan, as their absolute Lord. And not to execute them himself. And this he did discover to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12. 15. If confession of Sins constituted them true penitents, and rendred them true penitents, then they needed not be Paptized with the Holy Ghost by Christ. And if any say that it is meant of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Let them prove it, that it is so limited there, and never he Baptized: If they cannot have power by it to do Miracles. 16. <hi>If they that could m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If</hi> John <hi>was sent to the</hi> Jews <hi>only, and they were</hi> Israelites <hi>and seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>to whom it did belong, and appertain, to have, and enjoy; the External means of grace, being the then, only, visible Church of God upon Earth; Would it not have been a grievous sin in</hi> John <hi>the Baptist to have rejected any of them, or to have denyed Baptism to any of them? and if he had denied it to any as such, whether he might not have denied it to all as such? and if that was an insufficient ground for any one Soul, had it not been also insufficient for every Soul to be admitted to it upon that ground or Reason? and so they must either all be rejected or their admission be unlawful, and groundless, and what then would become of the Covenant that God had made with them? and all the Obligations they were under to come to the Lord Jesus under the pain of Hell flames; and every Soul of them, to be destroyed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People.</hi> Acts 3.23.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Now let us enquire whether it could be to glorify God? and certainly it could not be from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in them to glorify God. Though this ought to be the end of a confession of Sin,</hi> Joshua 7.19. <hi>But this could not be in them, being not in a state capable of it; Though their being baptized was a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42051:33"/> justifying of God,</hi> Luke 7.28, 29. <hi>Yet it is never said so of their confession, whatsoever is done to the glory of God must be in the Name of Christ; and him they did not yet know, nor believe in, but were baptized that they might believe in him.

And in case they did not the Lord Jesus would immediately, and speedily cut them down, and cast into Hell Fire, and this to all that were in the floor, so that if all did not confess their Sins, yet they that did were no better then they that did not; all were to tare alike, both in the way of Sin, and in the way of turning to God, the good shall have alike favour, and the bad should have like frowns. 6. As to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this confession, whether that can be proved to be the Adult only? and <hi>John</hi> baptized all without any limitation, or resurrection, that was <hi>all that were in the Floor, every Tree in the Field,</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and all</hi> Judea, <hi>and all the Region round about</hi> Jordan, <hi>the multitude, and all the People.</hi> And they that were not baptized by him, that refused it were sinners, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. So that it was such a confession as consisted with the capacity of all the subjects of it, which was young and old Male and Female, weak and strong. 7. Let us view, it as to the object of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, that so we may know whether it did then, and must for ever exclude Children? And as to the object of their confession to whom it was, there is not so much said of this confession as is of theirs, in Acts 2.37. <hi>They said to</hi> Peter <hi>and the rest of the Apostles Men, and brethren what shall us do to be saved;</hi> and the Jaylor cryed out, <hi>sirs,</hi> Acts 16.30. <hi>What shall I do to be saved?</hi> But here is no mention made of the object to whom it was directed, and therefore it cannot be accounted to be an advized, deliberrte verbal enumeration of Sins, either in general or particular, much less to be a rule, to make confession by the Mouth, to be a ground for the administration of Baptism to any; or to exclude others upon the account of their inabillity to make such a confession, when we have no example to whom to direct our confession, Here is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntion made of any object, of the act; and then, why should any be excluded for non performance of the act? Except the confession be limited, to that which is before mentioned, their horrour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and fear of the wrath that was coming, and asked what shall we do then? <hi>Luke</hi> 3.9, 10. and if that be the confession, then <hi>John</hi> must be the object of the confession, and if that be not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, then there must be no object to it, or of it; and then if they did not confess they know not what, yet it must be to whom they know not, and if it was to <hi>John,</hi> it was to none else; For all the rest confessed and there was none to hear but <hi>John,</hi> and if this their confession was like theirs, in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. Then it was a confession in order to direction, not for apprabation, trial, or absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to gain a right to Baptism. If it was to God, then no Man was to judg of it. If it was to <hi>John,</hi> we read none of his judgment of it. Therefore we do conclude, that whosoever did not, or were not able to moke it, were not then excluded from Baptism. Let us consider and view the adjuncts of the confession as the time, and place, and the work then done as concomitant with it. They were brptized of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan</hi> confessing their Sins. The place is tde River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> or in <hi>Joadan,</hi> and the time when, is not distinguished: as differing one from another, but as performed at one and the same time; as to their being there and coming forth to it, If not so as to be baptized all together.

Nor evidence them in a truly penitent state that did so cry out.

If we look upon this confession with respect to a moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42051:34"/> we may be the better satisfied about this confession. A moral confession, or a confession by actual submitting to, and receiving of Baptism, and this is that which the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of it, may bear. Our Saviour saith, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. <hi>That all the People that heard him, and the Publicans iustified God, being baptized with the Baptism of</hi> John. Their being baptized was their justifying of God, and the Pharisees and Lawyers not being baptized was their rejecting the counsel of God. So in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.25, and 32. compared, and here is nothing said of their confessing, or not confessing, but their believing or not believing the Doctrine of <hi>John,</hi> preaching Baptism, and their submission to it, or not submission to it, as a way and means to come to Christ, and receive from him. And so in <hi>John</hi> 3.33. He that hath received his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, hath set to his Seal that God is true. Justifying of God is receiviug the Testimony, that is sent by his Servants in his word and ordinances. Our acceptance of any one thing of grace, as grace, that is as a fruit of Gods free love through his Son, to Man, as an unworthy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable creature, is more a confession of our belief of the evil of Sin, and of our undone state and condition by it, than all the verbal codfessions that ever we can make; for in acceptance of any thing of grace we acknowledge all to be lost and we to be unworthy of the least of mercy, and we do acknowledg the riches of the grace of God in the least of mercy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.27. and hereby mannifest our belief of all that is said of him, and by this we renounce all our false trusts, and stand before the least of grace, as an utterly undone and unworthy creature. By this here is a full confession every way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.27. <hi>John</hi> preached Baptism as the way of repentance, and coming to Christ to have remission of Sins and the Baptizing with the Holy Ghost, and to be saved and delivered from the wrath to come. And their submission to this Baptism was their justifying of God in all that ever God had spoken concerning Sin, or their state by Sin, and of his grace and mercy in Christ, and in his truth and faithfulness to <hi>Abraham</hi> as well as his seed in his promise and covenant, see, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.55, 71, 72. to the end of the Chapter. And by this they professed their acceptation of it, and dependance upon him for it. And the Pharisees and Lawyers refusing or omitting this of Baptism, stumbled at the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, <hi>and rejected the whole counsel of God against them.</hi> So that there is nothing said of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and from thence we may safely conclude that it was of little concernment, but their moral a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>John</hi> 3.19, 20, 21. <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>John</hi> 3.33. This moral confession in coming to, and accepting the means and desiring and hoping for the good of it, was as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and as effectual as ever any verbal confession could be.

               <p>Particular arguments further to prove, and to confirm this truth that <hi>John</hi> did certainly Baptize Infants <hi>and ought as certainly to Baptize Infants in the Church of the Jews as the adult.</hi> Besides what hath been made to appear for the clearing up of this truth, by the explication of the texts of Scripture, and other things respecting the administrations of <hi>John</hi> Baptist, who was Christ's harbinger to the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> only. So also it may further be confirmed by arguments in particular, respecting the Ministry and administrations of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, and the subjects of his Ministry and administrations. And the first argument to prove that he did as certainly Baptise Infants, or Children, as the adult, is in that they were as expresly put into the Prophesie, and promise respecting <hi>Johns</hi> Ministry as the adult, and this from the Lord by <hi>Malachi,</hi> the last of the Prophets: <hi>Mala.</hi> 4.6.

Then surely this prediction that was so particular of <hi>John,</hi> and that by two immediate Officers, one upon Earth, and another from Heaven, must be a special and particular command to <hi>John</hi> Baptist to discharge his office to these persons of those ages, mentioned in these predictions.

They are as particularly mentioned as the Fathers. 3. They are presented to John, and looked upon by the Lord as in the same capacity with their parents or Fathers, and that is, as in a like state of Alienation from God, and without turning to the Lord as liable to the curse one as another.

And that is <hi>John</hi> Baptist as one filled with the Holy Ghost, like <hi>Elias.</hi> And the means that he was to use as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned from the Lord unto them, and among them, with the promise of Gods blessing upon his labours for the success of his Ministry, there is not one kind of meats to turn the heart of the Fathers, and another kind of means to turn the hearts of the Children. But one and the same means are appointed for all. As the Heart of all is alike for emptiness of good, and fullness of evil. So the same means, and messenger is sent to all alike they being all alike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sin. And this publick Doctrine, and publick Baptism was necessary and Fahers to turn the Hearts of the Children, and to turn them from sin, and to prepare them for the Lord, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Except any can prove that Children did not need so much means, or such means to turn them from sin, and to prepare them for the Lord as parents did. Or that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism with water wrs not to be a means to effect it in any, but to be a sign of the manner of their
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42051:35"/> reception of it. And as a Seal to confirm Gods promise to them that he would do it for them. To Seal their grace, that it could not do. Because they were all alike under sin, and had not the Holy Ghost, but were to receive it fram Christ, and not from <hi>John.</hi> And they had not believed in Christ. But they were to believe in Christ that was to come, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.4. Therefore it could not be <hi>a Seal to them to Seal their grace;</hi> Because that they had not, no more then they, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 38, 39. and if Baptism was to be a sign of the way of their reception of grace from Christ, and a Seal of the certainty of God's promise to them, that he would do it; <hi>Then the Infants must have it as well as the Adult;</hi> For else they must not have the sign of the way of their reception of Grace; And they and their parents must be at a loss to pray for it for them. And the promise of God must be left altogether at uncertainty, with respect to the Children. But doubtless of whatsoever use Baptism was appointed to be, <hi>to the Adult, to turn them,</hi> of the same use, and to the same effect it was appointed <hi>to be to the Infant,</hi> that their hearts might be alike turned. For that was the great end to which all was designed; and the great thing to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly the grace of God, blessing the means to them; and without his grace it would be effectual to none. And as it could not be effectual to any without <hi>divine grace;</hi> so none could have this <hi>divine grace</hi> without the <hi>divine means,</hi> for if they might have it without the <hi>means,</hi> then the <hi>means</hi> was appointed in vain. For God appointed the same <hi>means</hi> for all, both Parents and Children; and as the same <hi>means,</hi> so as much <hi>means</hi> for one as another, <hi>John</hi> as abundantly quallified, and all his <hi>administrations, and ministerial labours;</hi> and all to prepare them, a people for the Lord. And if God did not limit or appoint some <hi>means</hi> to the <hi>Adult parents,</hi> and other <hi>means</hi> for the <hi>Children.</hi> Nor promised his grace without <hi>means,</hi> or without all the <hi>means.</hi> But annexed the <hi>promise of good</hi> to all the <hi>means;</hi> or by, or in all the <hi>means</hi> to every one; and sent the same <hi>means</hi> to all, with the same ptomise of success. How dare then any poor mortal so limit it, or restaain it? <hi>Ʋbi lex non distinguit, non est distinguendum.</hi> Where the law does not distinguish, there we must not distinguish. If any do limit the <hi>means</hi> or the success of it to any, do they not discharge those persons they limit it to; from being under any obligation to wait upon, God in other means; though as certainly appointed by him as any other? and render those <hi>means</hi> as useless and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, because unprofitable to them; When God has sent all to them to the same end and purpose, without any limitation of the <hi>means,</hi> or <hi>subjects.</hi> This was contrary to what <hi>Paul</hi> did in the <hi>business of his Salvation, Phil.</hi> 3.11. and contrary to what every one else is bound to do, in the business of Salvation, in their time and places. For they are to have respect to all Gods commands. And to <hi>all that is written in the Book of the law,</hi> Deut. 28.58, 59. Indeed if <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism could be proved not to be <hi>a means</hi> to prepare them for the Lord; It being in the end of it to <hi>bring them to Christ to believe in him, Acts</hi> 19.4. Then they might have a shew to make some limitations, if they had all been such <hi>as had been brought to Christ before.</hi> But otherwise it will be an apparent contradiction to the express declared will of God, as to <hi>Johns ministerial la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> and the people he was sent to, to make any limitations. And if all that were to be baptized by <hi>John,</hi> had been true penitents, <hi>yet Infants and Children must have been baptized as well as Adult Parents;</hi> Because they were also in his commission, and had the promise of turning <hi>as well as the parents, to the Lord their God,</hi> Mala. 4.6. Luke 1.17. or else the prophesie must not be fulfilled, nor the promise performed, nor <hi>John's</hi> work done, which is contrary to <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24, 25. <hi>for he fulfilled or finished his course.</hi> Nor must the <hi>means</hi> he effectual to them, to whom it was sent, nor they have any good by it; Nor be bound alike to make use of it, and to bless God for it, and magnifie his free grace. But some, it may chance, will object and say, <hi>That by Children, we are not to understand Children of all ages, Infants as well as of riper Years.</hi> But by Children we are to understand a Proginy, and a generation that God would raise up, and that were <hi>Adult persons,</hi> who should be turned by <hi>Johns</hi> Ministry, and not of <hi>any Infants,</hi> or <hi>all Infants.</hi> For they were not capable to understand what <hi>John</hi> said, or did, nor make <hi>confession of their faith;</hi> So that it is to be taken as intended of a <hi>Proginy</hi> and not a <hi>Posterity. I answer,</hi> They that are here <hi>meant</hi> and <hi>intended</hi> as Children, in the Prophesie on promise, <hi>are all looked upon, as them that had a being in the World when</hi> John <hi>was to be sent to them, and in a state of sin, and strangers to God in their hearts And that needed to be turned, and them, that was Gods good pleasure to send the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If any limit the Word Seed to the elect only, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Answ.</hi> There it is spoken with respect to eternal Salvation, and not of being of the visible Church.</p>
               <p>We must distinguish the saving Benefits of the Covenant, and the external means and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations thereof; the being of the number of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed, obtained a Right to the external Means, by the immediate declared Will of God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.7 to 13. But the eternal and saving Benefits, that <hi>Isaac</hi> should partake of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.24. and the eternal Election only obtained that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6, 7. It is one thing what Man chuseth, and accounteth of, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And another thing what God chuseth and accounteth of, <hi>Ps</hi> 22.30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.17 to 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8.</p>
               <p>If by Seed any will have the elect only to be intended, that must partake of the means exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, then they must restrain God's own Declaration of his Will to be other than what he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21. and condemn <hi>Abraham</hi> for his understanding of it, of all, with respect to the means, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23.</p>
               <p>And if by the Seed be meant the Elect only, then they that administer Ordinances, must know who the elect are, or else their Work must be impossible, or they prostrate holy things to Dogs; see <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37.10 15. Nor must there be any visible Church in the World, and then not the converted only must partake of Ordinances, for there must be, and is, as yet, elect, that are uncalled.</p>
               <p>And if by Seed or Children be intended the elect only, then not them only, that can make a discovery of their Faith or Repentance, by a verbal profession or confession: But if it were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to the elect only, yet that will not exclude all Infants, for <hi>Isaac, Jacob, Sampson, Samuel</hi> and many others were elect when Infants.</p>
               <p>But besides what hath been alledged from the Absurdities, that will follow in case Infants are exempted from being intended by the Word Children, and the synonimous Expressions in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.

               <p>Which Covenant was made, or rather that Promise first given to <hi>Abraham</hi> expressly; and then also as expressly to all his, as to their being Subject; of the external Enjoyment of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations of the Signs and Seals of that Covenant, and all other external and visible Church-Priviledges. And as to all the further Manifestations and Discoveries thereof, made by God to them at sundry times, and in divers manners, as to the discovering with more and more clearness, the Riches of his Grace in that Covenant: And the clearest of all the Discoveries to be made, and was made by Christ at his coming, and his setting up his Kingdom among them by his Ordinances, and Revelation of his Mind by his Servants, who was himself the promised Messiah, and him with them, the Covenant made as Head; and in him for all that he did undertake for, and that were to be of his mystical Body, whether visible or invisible; and this as a fruit of God's free love, and the Communications to be by his Spirit, sn the way of his own Appointments, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his Word by his Prophets.</p>

And all that ever God spake or did to him or his, after the making of this Covenant, was with relation to this Covenant, and in order to the full accomplishment of it in things Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal.</p>
               <p>And for the further accomplishment and performance of this Covenant made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed, <hi>John</hi> Baptist was sent to the People of the Jews, as the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and Stock of <hi>Israel, John</hi> being the immediate fore-runner of Christ: And Christ himself was sent to them as the great accomplisher of this Covenant, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. from 40 to the end of the Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.32, 33. <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But before we come to shew the proof of the Identiny of the Covenant, that it was still one and the same, let one Objection be answered. Some do acknowledg the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 12.1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be a Covenant of Grace; but the Covenant mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they will needs have to be a Covenant of Works only for the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as temporal enjoyments to be had and obtained, upon conditions performed by him and his natural Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is devised and brought forth to be an Engine to pull all Infants out of the Covenant of Grace, and to exclude Baptism from being by God appointed to be a Seal and Sign of the Covenant of Grace, in the room and stead of Circumcision. But whatever nature this Covenant of Circumcision is asserted to be of by some, as to Works, yet they do not deny Children and Infants of eight days old to be actual partakers of it, or the Persons covenanted with, as certainly and really as any Adult Person at the first making thereof, and to the last; but they were as good deny Children to be the Subjects of it, as deny it to be a Covenant of Grace, it would be as much a Truth both as to Scripture and to Reason, and as to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their End, to exclude Children: For if it were true, that the Covenant made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. was a Covenant of Works; and Circumcision was a Sign and Seal of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works being a Covenant containing Conditions to be performed by <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed, for the enjoyment as well as attainment of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to be an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed for ever.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is against the very express Testimony of the Holy Ghost, that saith, <hi>Abraham</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the sign of Circumcision, a Seal of the Righteousness of the Faith which he had, being yet uncircumcised</p>
               <p>Now Faith must relate to the Covenant of Works, or else Circumcision must not; but Faith is not of Works, for these two, Faith and Works, are opposed as directly opposite and contrary one to the other, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12, 13, 14. And the Holy Ghost doth expressly make Circumcision to be a sign of the special spiritual saving Grace of the Spirit of God upon the Souls of them that did partake of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11. To the same purpose see <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.27, 28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25, 26. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.15. But as to Reason: Suppose it had been a Covenant of Works, and contained Conditions to be performed by them that partook of it; this would make nothing for the exclusion of Children or Infants from the Covenant of Grace, from God, through Christ, or of Gospel Priviledges through Christ, but rather be a strong Argument of their being as cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of it every way as any Adult Person whatsoever. For if that were a Covenant of Works, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. and depended upon Conditions to be performed, to attain it and enjoy it; then these Conditions must be performed solely by <hi>Abraham,</hi> as a publick Person for all his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or else these Conditions must be performed by every individual of his Posterity, as well and as fully as by him, and as particularly, by personal, perfect and perpetual Obedience.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Abraham</hi>'s performing of it, as a publick Person for all his Posterity, that cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; because the condition is as expresly required of every individual of his natural Seed, as of him, to be circumcised: And this by the express declared Will of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, and <hi>Isaac,</hi> and several others of them, they must be judged to do the Work, that is, perform the Condition of being circumcised; but had never the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> So they must lose their Reward and be wronged. Good Doctrin to justifie God, when it was promised to him and to his Seed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to his Natural Seed, and every Individual of them, they were to be Circumcised at Eight Days old, or be cut off from being of God's People, as Breakers of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12, 13, 14. So that every Individual of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Posterity is looked upon, in the capacity of Eight Days old, to perform this Condition of the Covenant of Works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here the Infant must at Eight Days old be supposed to know as much of the Mind of

And God that imposed it, do not question it, nor any Gainsayers that I know of, did ever question either the Infants Ability, or the Acceptable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Efficacy of what the Child did, or received in this case relating to Circumcision.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For God accepted it: And they were not cut off, if there was not a failure herein, as to personal, perfect, and perpetual Obedience, according to the nature of a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>First, the Infant Eight Days old, must be supposed to know as much, and understand as much of this Will of God concerning him, as to the Condition of this Covenant of Works, as <hi>Abraham.</hi> For if he did not know, how should he do or porform the Condition?</p>
               <p>If Knowledge of it was not necessary to the performance of it, Why did God reveal it to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham?</hi> And why was it made a Law, and contained in the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi> How readest thou? saith our Saviour to the young man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> else blind Obedience must be as good as knowing. And how is it possible for any Creature to do that which he doth not know, neither as to matter nor manner, nor end? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why should the Parents teach the Children in time to come, what the meaning of the Signs were, if they were not to know it, or could do it, and not know it? And why did God commend <hi>Abraham</hi> for teaching his Children and his Houshold after him, if they were not to know, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18, 19. And if any do imagine that blind Obedience would do, in the performance of a Condition to a Covenant of Works, Why may it not much more do in a Covenant of Grace, where all is given and received?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore taking it for granted, that they must know: Then this proveth that Children, even Infants at Eight Days old, were as capable to know as much as <hi>Abraham,</hi> as to the performance of this Condition of the Covenant of Works; Or else they could never do it.</p>
               <p>What persons do not know, they cannot do. But they did do. Therefore they did know as well as <hi>Abraham</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As they did, and are supposed to know by this Doctrin; So there must be a way supposed by which they did attain to this Knowledge. For there was a way whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> attained to his. And that must be Immediate or Mediate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> had his knowledge of it, Immediately discovered to him by God. And Children must have it this way, or some other way. As to Immediate Revelation, that way they could not have it: For then God must appear to them, as he did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> within the Eight Days, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were circumcised, even every Male-Child. For they were not to pass that age bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re they were Circumcised. God appeared to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. But we do not read that he appeared to all his Houshhold: And yet all were Circumcised the self-same Day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23, 24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Then there is not ground for Faith to believe that it was by Immediate Revelation that they did know. Though if it had, it would have shewed that Children were as capable of knowing, and receiving the Mind of God, as the Adult.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it were by means or mediate, then it must be by Birth from Parents, or by Education. As to Birth from Parents, if any should assert that, that would be monstrous; however <hi>Abraham</hi> could not be supposed to communicate it this way, to any that were circumcised the self-same day that God revealed it to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.23. to 27. because he did not know it himself till that day. And this knowledge must be supernatural and not natural, because all the Matters were a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Relation. And as some had it, so all must have it; they being all supposed a like able to perform the conditions of the Covenant of Works, for the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be attained. If it was not mediately gained by Nature, or natural Generation; then it must be attained by Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation after they were born.</p>
               <p>And if they will stand to this way, for the Childrens attaining their knowlkdge of these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Covenant of Works, of which Circumcision was the Seal; then they must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That Children, before eight days old, are capable of verbal Instruction from Parents or Friends, and were Subjects of the certain Blessing of God upon these Instructions; or else their performance of these conditions of this Covenant of Works by them, must be without the least knowledge of what they did. And they must have Faith in the Word of God, to believe the Word of God, in what he had said, or else they must not do as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; and the Blind, and Lame, and Halt, and Maimed, must be supposed to be as good, for the performance of these
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42051:39"/> conditions, as he. And as they must be Subjects of Knowledge and Faith, as to these conditions to perform them, relating to this Covenant of Work; so they must have Strength to do and perform these conditions, both as to doing and suffering. And this Strength must be personal and natural, or not: If it was not Personal, whereby every thing was done and suffered relating to this Covenant, for the performance of the conditions thereof, they could not do it as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and then can never be supposed to deserve the Reward: And if <hi>Abraham</hi> should do more than his Seed, he must have more, or else he must be wrong'd of his Reward. And by this Rule they must be supposed to be ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

They must be excluded from partaking of Baptism, when they could not come themselves to <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist;</hi> and when they could not speak and confess their Sins, tho' it was to partake of a Gospel-priviledge, as passive Subjects. And it would be strange, should they have help from others, both as to the supply of the want of bodily Strength and want of Speech, to perform the conditions of a Covenant of Works; and yet these conditions to be accounted as valid, as if they had done them themselves. And as to acceptation with God, and Efficacy for their good, and to fulfil the Law, requiring of these conditions every way as valid; surely this is strange: They brought the Child to do for him according to the Law, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.22. And the Priests in the Temple circumcise a Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.21, 22.</p>
               <p>And if there were required any actings of the Mind or inward Man in the performance of these Conditions, that they must be supposed to have as well as <hi>Abraham</hi> also. And all this, and whatsoever else was contained in these conditions and the performance of them, and their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, and answering the Law requiring it of them, and the efficacy of all to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them, to have part in the Inheritance; they must have of themselves, by Nature, or else must receive it from God.</p>
               <p>By Nature, as Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> they could not have it, neither their Knowledge, nor Faith, nor Strength, nor any thing of it; for then Sin had not undone them, so much as others; nor was not so evil and bitter a thing to provoke God, and ruin them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Jer. 2.19. as it was to others: Which is all contrary to the express Scripture of Truth.

And this did make them to differ from others, to do that which might get and obtain such an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in a good Land, flowing with Milk and Hony, which was the glory of all Lands.

               <p>From God immediately out of Christ it could not be; <hi>For he is a Fountain sealed, and only in Christ is the Fountain opened,</hi> Zech. 13.1. <hi>And Christ is the way to the Father,</hi> Joh. 14.6. And if this were not the way for temporal Mercies as well as for spiritual, why should all things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, Corn and Wine, and Oyl, the World, Life and Death, be made over in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by God, to Believers in Christ, if they might be had another way? <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.2, 12. to the end. And this to the Jews as well as Gentiles there; and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.20, 21, 22. and the working of them too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</p>
               <p>And if it must be through Christ, that they must receive it from God; then it must be by Grace. And they must be Partakers of this as unworthy Creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.47, 48. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.20, 21. &amp;c. And if they did and must receive all, through Christ, then how could they deserve this afterwards? Or by any Matter given them, by free Bounty, deserve the good Land? But however, this sheweth, That Children in their Infancy can receive from God, as well as Adult Parents, and that through Christ too; and can do as much as them, and their Works be as meritoriously acceptable to God, and have the same Reward as Parents, and that as the choicest of the Adult Fathers, even <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Enemies, to Children and Infants, being Judges, in what they assert so notoriously erroneous concerning the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, of its being a Covenant of Works; <hi>And the Promise was sure to all the Seed,</hi> Rom. 4.16. And if Children are every way as capable to perform the conditions required by God, in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, as well as their Adult Parents, in the state of their Infancy; then certainly they are every way as capable to receive any Grace of the Spirit of God, and any Priviledge that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:42051:39"/> it is his pleasure to confer upon them, as any Parent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5, 8. <hi>And without his good pleasure none can receive any thing,</hi> Rom. 9.16. Ephes. 1.11, 12. Phil. 2.12, 13. <hi>The Potters pleasure maketh of the same Lump, one Vessel to Honour and another to Dishonour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Lump hath no hand in any part of it, in its formation to a different Form, or end, into a Vessel. And where it is Grace that doth every thing for any to make to differ, every one is to admire and praise; <hi>None to find fault, but to be silent before the Lord,</hi> Rom. 3.19.9.22, 23. If <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Sampson,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> when Infants, were not as capable of being loved by God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was Adult; how could <hi>Abraham</hi>'s being beloved of God then, be as much of Grace as theirs, and theirs to be no more of Works than his? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.10.11, 12. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.6, 7.</p>
               <p>Observe here, by the way, what Reflections this notorious erroneous Opinion of the Covenant of Circumcision, being a Covenant of Works, casts upon the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham:</hi> As if it had been deficient of all things that tend to Life and Godliness. But he and his must have what they had to sustain them in this World, by a Covenant of Works; contrary to the express declared Will of God concerning his, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.20, 21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.13, 14. to the end. And when the Blessing that the Gentiles have, is not a greater Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing than what came upon <hi>Abraham, By Grace through Christ,</hi> Gal. 3.8.9.</p>
               <p>And it is a dreadful impudent Imagination in any, and much more assertion in them, or by them, to declare or publish, That any of the Race of Mankind are in a capacity to enter into any Covenant with God out of Christ, and in a state of Nature, or to perform any conditions; when not any one of the Race of Mankind have any more of his own, than what he brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World with him, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.1, 2.3, 12. and are dead in Trespasses and Sins. And the carnal Mind is enmity against God, and is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. And are Children of Gods Wrath and the Devil's Captives; and all this by divine Justice, Truth and Holiness. And for any to say, That any of these are capable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a Covenant of Works with God, and to perform conditions to obtain such an Inheritance, is so inconsistent with divine Justice, Truth and Holiness, and the evil nature of Sin, and Man's Enmity, Impotency and Misery, that it is rather to be Dogs Meat, than ever heard of amongst any, that own the Bible, or own a Saviour; and the Publishers of it to be cast out, as the Brats of bloody Papists. What <hi>Abraham</hi> had of that Nature, he had by Promise as well as any thing, and every thing else, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. Therefore I shall say no more, as to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of such a notorious Untruth here.</p>
               <p>But to come to prove the Identity of the Covenant: The Message that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and our Saviour, and all the Apostles, were sent to the Church of the Jews with, was the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment and performance of that Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed. And this as they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and the lost Sheep of the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the visible Church of God, at that time in the World, both Adult and Infant, even every Soul of <hi>Israel,</hi> as to the external Tender of the visible means they came with to them; and to the Infant as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly and as particularly as to the Adult, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17. That Infants were in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> is clear, from <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2, 7. <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.15, 16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.7, 13, 14, 18. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Covenant was a Covenant of Grace and free love, is as clear in that it was a Gift, and given to him and his Seed.

Nor could any action of the Subjects at that time, make any alteration as to the Covenant, or in them that did partake of it; as to visibility of action, I intend it; for they were visible Members and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects before, and at the time of <hi>John</hi>'s coming and after, till their final rejection after they had rejected and crucified the Lord Jesus. For any action, as their Confession of their Sins; this must be a supernatural or a natural Action. If it was a supernatural and spiritual action, it must be from a supernatural Principle, and so be acceptable to God and Christ. And this could make no change upon their state, but declare they were in Christ the true Vine, by their Fruit. Nor could this gain a right to the Ordinance, for that they had, both as to that, and all other Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges by union with Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.20, 21, 22. what day they did partake of that Grace, <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nor could that action of Confession make them meet for the Ordinance, for God judgeth of Men by their hearts; nor be of use as to the Ordinance, for the use of that was to cleanse them, as filthy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. And if Actions do give right, then not Qualifications inward. And if any say, they do before Men, that would be strange, that one Action before Men, or to one Man, should give a right to all visible Church-priviledges, and also the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that also makes divine Ordinances to be at Mans dispose, and not at Gods. If any say, They were natural Actions, as of Adult Persons, and in a state of capacity for the exercise of their Reason. <hi>Answer,</hi> If a natural Action that comes from so good a Treasure as the Heart-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural is, can gain a right to, and the enjoyment of such a Gospel-Ordinance as Baptism is; why may it not do every thing else, as to spiritual external Priviledges? And what need Grace or supernatural Endowments at all? And then Men may boast by a Law. 3. For Inferences. If the Covenant was not the same in <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s days, as to the Infant Subjects of it, as it was in the days of <hi>Abraham;</hi> so that Infants should not partake of the Administrations external. 1. Then God must repent of his Covenant as to the greatest number of the Subjects of it, in that Generation, that he had made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed. 2.

               <p n="2">2. For Inferences from the identity of the Promise: But if the Covenant and Promise was still the same to that People of the Jews, as it was to <hi>Abraham.</hi> 1. Then they must be looked upon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42051:43"/> as in the same capacity as <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed formerly were: And what that was see <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.2, 3, 4 to 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.1 to 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8 to 19.4.18, 19, 2, 21. <hi>Isa.</hi> 51.1, 2, 3. <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.1, 2, 3. 2. Then they must not bring any more to it than <hi>Abraham</hi> did, or any of his formerly: <hi>He was naked and bare,</hi> Ezek. 16. Hos. 2.2. Rom. 4.17, 18, 19. 3. Then their way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of it must be by reception, and not by doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.1, 2. 4. Then the Subjects must be the same, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. 5. Then there must be no ground for boasting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. 6. Then it must be sure to all the Seed, both as to the Grace and the Means, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7 to 14, 21, 22. 7. Then nothing of Endowments or actions must qualifie for it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.27 to 30. 8. Then all must be looked upon as wanting the same things, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17.4.18. <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3, 4. 9. Then their being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed entituled them to the external means, and not any thing in them, or done by them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5.3.2, 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.25, 26, 32. 10. Then the Infants must as certainly be the Subjects of <hi>John</hi>'s external Administrations as the adult, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7 to 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9, 10, 12. 11. If the Covenant was the same, then the Change of the external means, or way of dispensing, could make no alteration of the Subjects to come to it, so as that they should be qualified Persons, for the participation of the means, or the things conveyed by the means. For the thing promised was Life, and God to be their God, and remission of Sins and the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and turning to the Lord their God, and the Blessing that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had.</p>
               <p>And if they did not need it, they could not receive it, and more they did not want, and less God doth not promise nor Christ purchase. Nor were the means appointed for any other end, or can they attain more than bring us to Christ, and build up in Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12.5.25, 26, 27. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11, 12. 2. Another Argument may be drawn from the Promise of God, <hi>To turn Parents and Children to the Lord their God,</hi> Mal. 4.6. Luke 1.16, 17. It hath been proved before, That Children do contain Infants as well as Children of riper Years; and this must be, or else the Promise of God concerning the Success of <hi>John</hi>'s Labours upon Fathers and Children must fail. 3. From Baptism, being a means that he was to make use of to this end, to prepare them for the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17.</p>
               <p>That <hi>John</hi> did baptize them, as a means of their turning to the Lord, I prove from <hi>John</hi>'s Commission to baptize, <hi>John</hi> 1.31. <hi>Therefore am I come baptizing with water.</hi> Therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? because Christ was to be manifest to <hi>Israel,</hi> to <hi>baptize with the Holy Ghost,</hi> John 1.32.33. 2. From <hi>John</hi>'s own Words to them, That he <hi>indeed baptized them with water, but he shall baptize with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.</hi> 3. From <hi>John</hi>'s end in baptizing them, which was, <hi>That they might believe in him that was to come,</hi> Acts 19.4. 4. From the success of his baptizing them, which was, <hi>Their pressing into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 11, 10, 11. compared with <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.28, 29.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may have ground to believe that <hi>John</hi> baptized Infants, from the universality that he baptized, on the generality or extent of the subjects of his Baptism: Which was every Tree in that Field, all that had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father, all that were to be damned or saved, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9, 10, 12. All Flesh in <hi>Israel;</hi> and none were without it, but those that were Rejecters of it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From <hi>John</hi>'s allowing them their Priviledges as Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and casting out none that were in that Floor as Members of the Jewish Church. He told them that Christ would purge his Floor, which shewed that he did not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5. It was theirs as Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he did not deny it to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 26, 5, 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.24, 25.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In that it was administred by <hi>John</hi> to none as any way priviledged more than others of the House of <hi>Israel</hi> and Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> either as to Age, Sex, State, Qualification, Office, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or Opinion whatsoever, than only as the Stock of <hi>Israel</hi> and Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all <hi>Israel, Acts</hi> 13.24. If we read of none, then there was none; but we read of none, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.14.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In that he fulfilled his course, that is, did the Work that God sent him to do, <hi>Malac.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. <hi>John</hi> 1.31. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24, 25.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In that he declared to them that he did but Baptize them with Water, which was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means only, and this belonged to all the Seed of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, to 16. All of them were Children of the Kingdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. The Chaff as well as the Wheat, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.10, 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In that he preached it, and made tenders of it to all the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> which gave them warrant to come, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24. When <hi>Moses</hi> called all <hi>Israel,</hi> all were to come, and did come, and all took into Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.10, 11, 12, 13. compared with <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.25.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42051:43"/>9. In that he was Christ's Harbenger and Forerunner, and ministred to all that Christ mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to, which was to the Circumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. compare that with <hi>Acts</hi> 21.19 to 25.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In that he Baptized them that they might believe in Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.24. Now if this was his declared end in Baptizing, then all must be Baptized that were to believe in Christ, whose duty it was to believe in Christ; and that was the duty of every Soul in <hi>Israel, Acts</hi> 3.23. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. They were not Baptized as those that did actually believe in him before: But that they should believe on him; and should he have kept any from it, then he must have discharged all such from that duty.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In that the Scripture is universally and totally silent of <hi>John</hi>'s destroying the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or overturning the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or excluding the Subjects of the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which must all have been done, had any Infants, much more all Infants have been excluded in <hi>Israel.</hi> This would have made him the least in the Kingdom of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18, 19. But he expresseth the contrary, that he looked upon them all as Chaff, or Wheat in Christ's Floor, and so Baptized them. And if the Scripture do say nothing of his exclusion of none, we have no ground for Faith to believe he shut out or excluded any, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Paul</hi> said nothing, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved any thing, but what <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets did say should come, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.22. And what was contained in the Law, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.14. that he believed, and all things of it: And had he not believed all that <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets did say should come, and none other than that, how should he have delivered it to others for them to believe it?</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Baptizing of Infants, and their being Members in the Gospel-Church, is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified and proved by the filling of <hi>John</hi> with the Holy Ghost from his Mother's Womb, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. So that neither <hi>John Baptist,</hi> nor any others, could say any thing against Children, being of the Subjects of Christ's Kingdom that he was to set up in the World. Or as to their incapacity to partake either of external Ordinances, or internal Graces, if God please to pour them out, and without his pleasure none could partake of them. In that <hi>John</hi> was capable of receiving as great a measure of the Spirit of God from the Womb, as <hi>Elijah</hi> had, or was capable of partaking of, when he was Adult and at old Age, and in a great and immediate Office; and none can say that <hi>John</hi> attained to <hi>Elias</hi> degree of the Spirit, by his growing up in years: For the express-word is, <hi>That he should be filled with the Holy Ghost from his Mother's Womb;</hi> And he could be but filled; and we do not read that he had any more matter or parts added to him as a new Creature; though it be said, <hi>He waxed strong in Spirit,</hi> that respects but his exercise of the same matter and variety of parts: As the strength of the Body doth not consist in any addition of any one Member, or any new matter to it, that constitute any new part, but a degree for the acting and manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts. For the Soul was the subject receiving of the Holy Ghost and that doth not grow: and therefore it was the same Spirit for measure that <hi>Elias</hi> had: for he was now to go before Christ in the Spirit of <hi>Elias. Jacob</hi> was beloved of God, and all his Seed had no more; compare <hi>Malac.</hi> 1.1, 2. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9 10, 11. <hi>Solomon</hi> was filled with Wisdom when young, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3, 12, 28. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>John</hi> was filled from his Mother's Womb with the Holy Ghost, none could o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ject against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, being of that Church where <hi>John</hi> was Minister; and especially when their Names were as express in the Promise as <hi>John</hi>'s, of as the Adult, <hi>Malac.</hi> 4.5, 6. and they were all as express Children of the Covenant in that Church, as <hi>John</hi> or any others, as to the external means, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, to 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.14, 15 16, 17. It was foretold of <hi>John,</hi> That he should be filled with the Holy Ghost from his Mother's Womb, and that his Parents should have Joy and Gladness in him, and many should rejoyce at his Birth: And his Mother did bear this Testimony of <hi>John,</hi> that he did leap for Joy, when the Voice of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Salutation sounded in her Ears, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.44. And this was spoken out with a loud Voice, and not whispered; so that it must of necessity be known among the people, and be remembred by them, when <hi>John</hi> came to his Administrations, and the exercise of his Office. But if any should object and say, that <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s Joy was a Miracle, and so his filling with the Holy Ghost. And so also <hi>David</hi>'s hoping when he hung upon his Mother's Breasts, <hi>Psalm</hi> 22.9. And <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Act in taking his Brother by the Heel, <hi>H sea</hi> 12.3. <hi>Answer,</hi> Not so much a Miracle, as that which is affirmed by many, That the Infants at ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42051:44"/> as the multitudes coming out to him to see, and all of them be converted, and be able to make out their being true Penitents by their confession of Sins: And by this gain a right to, and the actual enjoyment of a right to, and a participation of all Church Priviledges to be had in Gospel-times, and yet hear no one Sermon that we read of preached to them, but the Baptism of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.7, 8, 9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.6, 7. And <hi>John</hi>'s Joy was not so much a Miracle as what many affirm of the <hi>Eunuch, Acts</hi> 8.34, to 39. That he should hear but one Sermon, that ever we read of, and yet then have saving Faith wrought in his Heart, and he know that he had it, and be able to make it forth by a Confession before <hi>Philip,</hi> as a Judge of it, and this Confession to give him right to partake of the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, and this to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Rule for all ever after. That none must be Baptized, as some say, or no Adult person, as others say, without a Confession of their Faith. And the Jaylor to hear but one Sermon that ever we read of, and he be Baptized the same Hour of the Night; so that the Sermon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and all, was not long in the performance, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.32, 33. and yet he must be supposed to make a confession of his Faith, or else his Baptism must be concluded to be irregular, and go for nothing. And the like Miracle must be held about <hi>Lydia, Acts</hi> 16.14, 15. Though the Scripture do say nothing of a Confession, yet it must be supposed, because the <hi>Eunuch</hi> did. But we may take notice, That what is said of <hi>John</hi>'s Joy, is not implyed, nor supposed, but expressed and affirmed, and that twice: Once by the Mother that best knew it, and this in a way of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, when she was filled with the Holy Ghost, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.41. And certainly it is not to be supposed that such an ancient holy Matron as <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was, when filled with the Holy Ghost, should, or did offer to God things untrue, either materially, formally, or subjectively. Thus it is written, whether we believe it or not, she did praise God for it. <hi>John</hi>'s joy in the Womb must be spiritual or carnal, natural or supernatural. If it had a supernatural Revelation for the cause of it, then it must be supernatural. But that it had in <hi>Mary</hi>'s Salutation. 2. If it had a spiritual and supernatural Object, then it must be spiritual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that it had a spiritual and supernatural Object, the Lord Jesus Christ; therefore it must be spiritual. <hi>John</hi> must rejoyce in Christ, as he was to be the Forerunner of Christ, and so rejoyce in his being a Prophet, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in Christ as his Saviour. They that are minded to clear up that <hi>John</hi> rejoyced more in his Office, than in Christ as a Saviour, may do it, if they can, and have good thanks for their pains. All supernatural Grace is a Miracle, and above the power of Nature, in whomsoever it is wrought. But the quickening of one dead Soul, or the Spirit of Lifes entring into, or blowing upon one dead Soul, is no more a Miracle in one than in another, it being in all a new Creation, and a new Birth: And the introduction of a supernatural spiritual Being, and depends upon the same Causes for Infusion and Influence in every thing in all persons, and have a like opposition in every Soul as to habits of Sin and Captivity to the Devil that keeps the House. The Hearts of all being alike by Nature, as to absence of Good, and presence of Evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, 10. And special Grace hath no more for acceptance or assistance in one than in another. Seeing no unclean thing can bring forth a clean, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. And these things being considered, <hi>John</hi>'s Joy could be no Miracle. For the Influence of Grace for Action must come from the same Causes as the Infusion of the Habits, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9, 10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12, 13. But how could <hi>John</hi>'s Experience of the Grace of God poured upon him from his Birth, consist with his exclusion of Children and Infants as uncapable, or as not in the Covenant; When God's Grace had been so abundant to him, and done all for him so early and so freely and abundantly? Could he judge all others to be lost, and as uncapable to receive any thing in their Infancy, when he had received so much then himself by Grace; and preached to the people, That God was able of Stones to raise up Children to <hi>Abraham, Matth.</hi> 3.9. And to judge a Generation of Vipers only capable to receive; and this when their Names were as express in the Promise as any; and all Infants in <hi>Israel</hi> had God for their God, as to external means, as much as any? <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>And for the People that had Children and Infants among them, what would they have said? All the Jews having great regard for their Childrens Priviledges; witness that great Assembly called about them, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And the much Disputings, the Apostles, those great Officers, had about the Priviledges of Children, as of them they believed should be saved by the grace of Christ as well as themselves, <hi>Act.</hi> 15, 9, 10, 11. And see their respect to Children, and their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, in <hi>Acts</hi> 21.18, 19, to 25, When the thousands that did believe must have satisfaction of <hi>Paul,</hi> for that they had heard he had disswaded the Jews among the Gentiles, to neglect their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42051:44"/> Children. And when they had such esteem of their Children, and knew how much <hi>John</hi> had done for him by the grace of God in his Infancy; should he have cast out all Infants as uncapable of any thing of Gospel-priviledges? And that they must not partake of the means by which they might be obliged to go to Christ, and to believe in him, and be by him baptized with the holy Ghost? All must have mourned at the Birth of an Infant, to consider what an undone Creature an Infant was, and how uncapable to receive any help. They must have told <hi>John,</hi> that he would have cast them out too, if they could not have made their Confession, and deserved to have been admitted, if he did require Confession for admittance.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It may be confirmed that <hi>John Baptist</hi> did as certainly baptize the Infants as the Adult in <hi>Israel,</hi> from the partiality, diversity and confusion that must have been in <hi>John Baptist</hi>'s Ministry and Administrations, if Infants should have been excluded Baptism. For then, tho' he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to all, yet he must administer it only to some, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.24. And tho' young and old were in his Commission, yet he did admit only the old. And either the Covenant must be regarded or not regarded by him; if it was regarded by him at all, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> must be for the Adult only, but not for the Infants. A Generation of Vipers must have their Priviledge, as being in the Covenant; but not the poor Infants, no not one. And if any should be accounted or imagined to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the account of their Confession, as true Penitents; how would that consist with his Titles that he gives them, and with his dreadful Threatnings to them, if he esteemed them as true Penitents? <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9, 10, 12. And would that consist with his baptizing of them with Water, and promising that Christ should baptize them with the Holy Ghost, and baptizing them to believe in Christ? was this consistent with true Penitency? Could they be true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and not have the Holy Ghost? And could they Repent, and yet not believe in Christ? And if Infants should have been rejected by him, upon the account of their incapacity, how would that consist with the Doctrin of the Power and Efficacy of the Grace of God, to raise up Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the Stones? It was Power to raise them up, and Grace to make them Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of <hi>Abraham.</hi> What partiality must it have been in him, to admit some to have their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to deny others of the Seed of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Mat. 3.9. And if Baptism was a Sign and Seal of the Covenant of Grace, and especially of the pouring out of the Spirit by Christ, and his baptizing them with the Holy Ghost, then all Infants must for ever be excluded from having any thing of the good, contained in the Covenant, or deliverance from the evil therein contained; or else they must be for ever excluded from the Sign whereby this is signified to them, or of the Seal whereby the certainty of it is assured to them, from the truth and faithfulness of God to perform it to them. All that is contained in the Doctrin of the Gospel must never be represented to them in the Sign, nor never assured to them by the Seal; but all that respects the Adult, must be both signified to them and sealed, tho' they were a Generation of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. This would have made the Promise otherwise to all the Infants of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Posterity, than it was to <hi>David</hi>'s Posterity; for it was to them in all things well ordered and sure, tho' yet they had little of it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3, 4, 5. as sure as it was to <hi>David.</hi> But it may be there are some that will say, That that Text speaks of the Promise and Covenant that respects that Kingdom, and his and their being King and Kings. <hi>Answer,</hi> Tho' that be notoriously false, yet that will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Truth pleaded for. For if temporal Things are as sure to the Infant as to the Adult in the Promise, and by the Promise, then much more spiritual and eternal Things; and therefore must be sealed to them: That is, the Infant as well as to the Adult, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. The Adult must have it sealed and assured to them, that they should have remission of Sins and the Spirit poured out upon them in the way of Repentance, and going to Christ and believing in him; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Mercies, they must be left at all uncertainties. They that have Faith to believe it, and Conscience to assert such things, may for me. All the means were sent to Fathers and Children, from the same Grace, by the same qualified and constituted Officer, to the same end, to do the same Work for all; and that was to turn their Hearts. He preached it to all, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.24. And it is as sure a word of Prophesie to all, as to some; or else it must be uncertain, whether any Soul shall be damned or saved, cursed or blessed, to whom it is not sure: And so Hell and Heaven must be prepared for Uncertainties, and the places of any there, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.25. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.33.</p>
               <p n="14">14. If the being baptized, was a flying from wrath to come, then Infants were, and must be baptized, or else the door of safety was shut against them, <hi>that they should not fly from the Wrath to come,</hi> but they must be exposed to it without all visible hopes of deliverance, or escape from
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42051:45"/> wrath to come. But this Baptism, and the being baptized by <hi>John,</hi> was a <hi>flying from Wrath to come,</hi> Luke 3.6, 7. <hi>John</hi> Baptist must be more cruel to all Infants of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and Stock of <hi>Israel,</hi> than some of the Egyptians were to their Servants and Cattle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.20, 21. If he or any Parents should have kept from, or not brought Infants to Baptism; and this against a more express and particular Word for them to come, than ever the Egyptians had, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Another Argument may be from the Lord Jesus dividing all the People into two sorts, them that were baptized by <hi>John,</hi> and them that were not, but rejected Baptism, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.28, 29, 30. Now if all the People consisted of them that were baptized and justified God, and them that sinned and were nott baptized, but rejected God, in it and his counsel against themselves, then there was no third sort in <hi>Israel,</hi> and of the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that were neither to justifie God in being baptized, nor be condemned, as sinners against their own Souls, in rejecting of it: If none were not baptized but such as rejected it, and sinned in so doing; then there was none that <hi>John</hi> did exclude from it, or deny it to: Nor no Conditions or Acts of Confession required for Baptism, but what all could perform, except they were rejecters of Baptism.</p>
               <p n="16">16. From the certain, but strange overthrow that <hi>John</hi> must make of all the express Commands and Appointments of God Almighty in the Church of the Jews, if he should have excluded Children from Baptism; and this when all of them were in full Force, and not one of them put an end to. For their being Members visible by the commanded way of Initiation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. The constitution and the separation of the first-born, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.22. The Covenant, declared by <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. in which the Children a span long were as real Subjects of as the adult, were all to be at the reading of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Song, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.10, 11, 12, 13.32.25. The godly Seed that God did seek must be all put an end to, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. it must be all rendered as unlawful and irregular, if Children should have been excluded Baptism, and all their solemn Meetings commanded, where Children were admitted, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.14 15, 16, 17. And <hi>Ezrah</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming a Fast to seek God for their good, must be rendred as unlawful, being Subjects that God would cast out, and take only adult confessors of Sins.</p>
               <p n="17">17. From the Qualifications of those that were admitted, which were Publicans and Harlots, and a generation of Vipers. Now if Sin have rendred any unmeet for visible publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Priviledges, it is such whose Hands were full of Blood, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.12 to 18. And if Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was required as a Qualification, then of certainty and necessity Children must be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being there could be nothing laid to their Charges; and it was impossible there should any possitive Grace be made known by them that were so rife in Sin: Neither is there any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Nature or Quality of their Confession, as discovering any true Penitency, whatever Men do imagine.</p>
               <p n="18">18. From the universal silence of the People, in saying nothing, nor making any Complaint about the exclusion of their Children from all their great and glorious Priviledges, if they had been excluded. There was a great mourning, and a refusing to be comforted, when <hi>Herod</hi> kill'd but a few of them, though they might every Soul of them be happy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.16 to 22. Did they understand their own Priviledges, and make Confession of their Sins, to partake of it in order to go to Christ, that was now to appear? And was all of them as cruel as the Ostrich, as to the All of their own poor Infants Souls, and not say one Word; that there should be no Voice, nor hearing of one Word of any of them? The Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ents made bitter complaints about the wants of the Bodies of their Children, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3, 4. And was there none that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their Souls now?</p>
               <p n="19">19. From their then being under an express Command, to present their Children to God in all Divine Worship. And their practice at that day to do it, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.24. <hi>John</hi> 7.20, 21, 22. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18, 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.59. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26, 27, 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30, 31 10.2. they made this their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, with the rest of their Observations: And that was a Command for Parents to bring them to <hi>John, Mal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.17. how else could they sin that did not come, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.30. or where else should they have any warrant that did come?</p>
               <p n="20">20. The Command of God then, and also still binding Children to obey their Parents, and follow their Examples in the things of God, and the promising of Blessing annexed to it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18, 19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The respect that the multitude had for their Children in those Days, in what they did, and what they said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.25, 26, 27. The reproach it was to be barren among them, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42051:45"/> 25. their blessing the <hi>Wombs that never bear, and the Paps that never gave suck,</hi> Luke 23.29. The Lamentation that was made for <hi>Jairu</hi>'s Daughter, shews that there was a respect for Children in those Days</p>
               <p n="22">22. The great Discouragement and Dissatisfaction that it must have been in those days, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to all godly conscientious Parents, both with respect to their great Pains and godly edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, and with respect also to their eternal salvation, should all Infants then have been excluded Baptism. They looked upon <hi>John</hi> as a Prophet indeed, and Baptism was preached to them by him, to be the sign and obligation of them to believe in the Messiah; and should their Children have been excluded, Parents must have cried out, Our strength and our hope is perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Lord, as to all visible hope and help of means, or any blessing upon means for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as to this World and another: For if Baptism be a seal upon God's part, or upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers part, it must call all into question whether ever one of them have any part or lot in all that is spoken or promised, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3, 4, 5. This was <hi>David</hi>'s hope and all his Hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as to his Children, in a dying hour. And how did it engage him to go in, and stay before the Lord, and beg earnestly of him, that he would stablish his word and bless his house, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, 27. And <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry was wonderfully effectual to stir up the people, and encourage them to go to God, and not to discourage them: And that not for themselves but for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.10, 11.15.24 to 28.8.8, 9, 10.9.22, 23. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s life was bound up in the Lad's Life. If the exclusion of Children and Infants that were of the Church of God, from it, would have discouraged parents in their going to God, then there was no such exclusion made in <hi>John</hi> Baptist's days, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.16, 17 to 22. If Children's inclusion in the Promise and Favours of God, would draw Parents Hearts after God, then Children were not cast out, but taken into Church Priviledges in these days. But that it doth, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18, 26, 27. <hi>ergo Matth.</hi> 11.10, 11.</p>
               <p n="23">23. This proves the Infants of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be then as certainly baptized as the Adult, in that the Holy Ghost doth this witness after <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, That it was theirs as well as any ones else, of the stock of <hi>Israel:</hi> And this as they were Israelites, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4, 5. who are Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law and the Promises. If any can exclude Baptism from these, let them do it, and exclude them also from all the rest. If they will say this did not belong to Gospel-times, let them read the fifth verse, whose are the Fathers, and of whom, as concerning the Flesh, Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. If there is any Church Priviledge that any one had not, that was Infant or Adult, of the Seed of <hi>Israel,</hi> that is, that had a Father and a Mother that were Israelites, according to the Flesh, then all Israelites must have it, but all must be deprived by the same reason that any one person was deprived; and what was done to any as matter of Wrong, can never be a rule of Right for others: And this was asserted of the Jews long after <hi>John</hi> Baptist's Days. See also <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1.3.2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.31. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46.3.25, 26. The whole of the Gospel is called, <hi>their spiritual things,</hi> Rom. 15.27. Now if it was theirs, and did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein to them as Israelites, then it would have been sin in <hi>John,</hi> and matter of condemnation to him to have kept any from Baptism, much more all Infants: But Christ commends <hi>John</hi> and his Ministry, as one that was greater than any of the Prophets before him; and as one that came in a way of righteousness, and therefore not in a way of wronging and robbing of them of their Priviledges, and much less of Gospel Ordinances: And therefore the Infants in <hi>Israel</hi> were all certainly baptized, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.32. <hi>He did his Work,</hi> Acts 13.25.</p>
               <p n="24">24. If <hi>John</hi> should have excluded any, much more all Children, then all in the visible Church, or of that only Floor that Christ was to come to, had not been the Object for Christ's Fan. But all that visible Church are declared by <hi>John</hi> the Baptist to be the object of Christ's Fan, on all that were in that only Floor that Christ was to come to; therefore none, and much less all Children were not cast out by <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>John</hi> was but the preparer of the way of Christ, to come to them, not the purger out of the Church.</p>
               <p n="25">25. From the speediness of the Execution to be done upon them, as threatned by <hi>John;</hi> as speedy as the Tree to be cut down, that the Ax is laid to the Root of: And as speedy as the Chaff is to be blown away, when the Fan is in the Hand of the Fanner, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10, 12. So that they must be all prepared for Christ, and bring forth Fruit, because Christ was to come against them with speedy and utter Destruction. Now should <hi>John</hi> have cast out all the Infants, they must have been cast out for ever. Because the visible Church of the Jews were speedily to be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: God was ready to come and smite them with the Curse. And therefore <hi>John</hi> was to use all

               <p n="27">27. From the knowledge <hi>John</hi> had of the Prophecies, and the regard he had to the fulfilling of them, <hi>John</hi> 1.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2, 3, 4. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.2, 3. That he regarded the fulfilling of them, see <hi>Mat</hi> 11.2, 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.12, 13, 14. <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.20, 21. <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.3.</p>

Nor must they ever see; that is, enjoy the means of Salvation here, or the matter of Salvation hereafter. And if this be true of all Infants, then the Adult, nor one Adult Person, must see it neither, but that Generation of Adult in <hi>John</hi>'s days. For when any are cast out and excluded, as not being in the Commission for the means, they must be cast out for ever: For who could ever bring them in again? And how then should they have bore a part in the praising of Christ in the Temple? <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.14, 15. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.39, 40.
